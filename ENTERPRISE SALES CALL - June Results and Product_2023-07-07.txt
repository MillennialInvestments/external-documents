0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.710
Jeffrey Warwick
Can you guys hear me?
0:0:0.760 --> 0:0:1.720
Jeffrey Warwick
Sorry, I've been talking quietly.
0:0:3.630 --> 0:0:3.830
Adrian Garcia
Yep.
0:0:3.200 --> 0:0:4.230
Speaker 1
Yeah, we can hear you better now.
0:0:4.700 --> 0:0:5.810
Adrian Garcia
And I did start recording.
0:0:5.820 --> 0:0:9.660
Adrian Garcia
So we'll have a we'll have this dereference, absolutely.
0:0:9.510 --> 0:0:10.110
Speaker 1
Perfect.
0:0:10.120 --> 0:0:10.460
Speaker 1
Thank you.
0:0:11.250 --> 0:0:15.720
Jeffrey Warwick
Umm to everyone I have this quote that I've already edited.
0:0:15.970 --> 0:0:17.350
Jeffrey Warwick
I've added products to it.
0:0:17.360 --> 0:0:24.360
Jeffrey Warwick
This has an Ethernet 50 Meg bandwidth product on it, so Ethernet would need to go through the SE.
0:0:25.210 --> 0:0:27.160
Jeffrey Warwick
So basically I create my quote.
0:0:27.770 --> 0:0:30.560
Jeffrey Warwick
Let's say I forgot the task my see in this instance.
0:0:30.790 --> 0:0:35.380
Jeffrey Warwick
When I go to submit my quote for approval, I'll be able to enter whatever I want.
0:0:38.810 --> 0:0:41.130
Jeffrey Warwick
Usually it should be a, you know.
0:0:41.810 --> 0:0:46.450
Jeffrey Warwick
Explanation for why this needs to be approved and why it's going to the approval that's going for.
0:0:47.890 --> 0:0:50.620
Jeffrey Warwick
But in this case I'm gonna breeze through that and submit it.
0:0:51.850 --> 0:0:58.800
Jeffrey Warwick
So in this instance, since I have Ethernet on the quote, it's gonna create 2 approvals for me.
0:0:58.890 --> 0:1:3.140
Jeffrey Warwick
One is gonna go through the SE 1st now and then the other one.
0:1:3.150 --> 0:1:4.170
Jeffrey Warwick
Oh, it looks like it didn't even work.
0:1:5.380 --> 0:1:7.590
Jeffrey Warwick
Hang on, that's confirm.
0:1:13.210 --> 0:1:14.80
Jeffrey Warwick
Technical difficulties.
0:1:19.810 --> 0:1:20.410
Jeffrey Warwick
Let's try it again.
0:1:24.770 --> 0:1:27.111
Speaker 1
And just and just while he's E.
0:1:28.530 --> 0:1:28.840
Speaker 1
As you.
0:1:28.910 --> 0:1:29.50
Speaker 1
See.
0:1:29.590 --> 0:1:30.820
Speaker 1
It said price floor exception.
0:1:31.470 --> 0:1:32.70
Speaker 1
Because.
0:1:33.390 --> 0:1:34.660
Jeffrey Warwick
Yeah, there it.
0:1:34.670 --> 0:1:34.710
Jeffrey Warwick
Is.
0:1:32.790 --> 0:1:40.250
Speaker 1
If it does have a pipe price for exception, it'll go through that same approval, so you don't have to do 2 approvals if it doesn't.
0:1:40.360 --> 0:1:40.570
Speaker 1
Have a.
0:1:40.630 --> 0:1:41.610
Speaker 1
Price floor exception.
0:1:41.620 --> 0:1:48.80
Speaker 1
You wouldn't see that drop down if it did have a price floor exception, then you will see that drop down as well.
0:1:48.90 --> 0:1:53.740
Speaker 1
So no additional action from you, all from the AE from this standpoint.
0:1:54.760 --> 0:2:0.970
Jeffrey Warwick
You're correct and as you can see, you can see there's two approvals that are sent over here.
0:2:0.980 --> 0:2:2.950
Jeffrey Warwick
One of them is the new SE approval.
0:2:3.140 --> 0:2:6.150
Jeffrey Warwick
So as I'm logged in as Cody, the the Tim is his AZ.
0:2:6.580 --> 0:2:8.430
Jeffrey Warwick
The first approval will go through him.
0:2:8.600 --> 0:2:14.460
Jeffrey Warwick
If you guys have communicated with your SE, they'll basically have their work done already and approve this right away.
0:2:14.470 --> 0:2:26.200
Jeffrey Warwick
So it'll just move right into the next stage of approval, which is the E, the E the product floor approval, which is the next stage and then it'll go to the standard financial approval after that.
0:2:26.820 --> 0:2:34.980
Jeffrey Warwick
So it's just a new first step and only when the specific and specified products that we'll lay out for you have been selected in a quote.
0:2:37.480 --> 0:2:40.580
Speaker 1
And it would also, once everything is approved, the status.
0:2:43.150 --> 0:2:43.420
Jeffrey Warwick
Mm-hmm.
0:2:40.590 --> 0:2:47.710
Speaker 1
So right now you see that is in review, so once it is approved, it'll go to the approved status.
0:2:47.880 --> 0:2:49.320
Speaker 1
So let's say that there.
0:2:49.600 --> 0:2:51.770
Speaker 1
Not a financial approval.
0:2:58.340 --> 0:2:58.540
Jeffrey Warwick
Mm-hmm.
0:2:51.780 --> 0:3:3.770
Speaker 1
It's only a SE approval and a product floor approval then it will, you know, then it's just the AE, it'll automatically go to approved for you.
0:3:4.590 --> 0:3:6.990
Speaker 1
So you are good to go with that.
0:3:8.360 --> 0:3:14.760
Speaker 1
So any questions on what you'll see Monday, July 17th?
0:3:19.660 --> 0:3:19.840
Jeffrey Warwick
No.
0:3:21.310 --> 0:3:21.530
Jeffrey Warwick
OK.
0:3:20.940 --> 0:3:26.220
Speaker 1
Alrighty, Hayden, would you like to add anything to this from the SE perspective?
0:3:26.150 --> 0:3:26.600
Hayden Tuttle
No, ma'am.
0:3:27.660 --> 0:3:28.70
Hayden Tuttle
All good.
0:3:27.940 --> 0:3:30.660
Speaker 1
Alright, thank you so much, Jeffrey.
0:3:31.720 --> 0:3:32.40
Jeffrey Warwick
This one.
0:3:29.520 --> 0:3:34.810
Adrian Garcia
And this this is this is gonna be documented right in the in the Salesforce guide.
0:3:35.640 --> 0:3:36.870
Speaker 1
Ohh absolutely.
0:3:37.260 --> 0:3:37.440
Adrian Garcia
Yeah.
0:3:36.880 --> 0:3:40.730
Speaker 1
So umm, so I will be updating the guide.
0:3:40.740 --> 0:3:42.950
Speaker 1
I will be sitting that that out communication.
0:3:43.20 --> 0:3:46.650
Speaker 1
So just be on the lookout for the communication from Gigi as well.
0:3:46.780 --> 0:3:51.290
Speaker 1
It will have the link to the updated God, but you all know where to find it.
0:3:51.300 --> 0:4:5.990
Speaker 1
If you don't know where to find it, I'll make sure that you know we tag it on this call or when she sends out the communication and has it has the the link to actual fund the the updated sales document.
0:4:6.860 --> 0:4:7.750
Adrian Garcia
Yeah, we know we have.
0:4:6.770 --> 0:4:8.0
Speaker 1
But if you don't know where it's at.
0:4:7.760 --> 0:4:11.530
Adrian Garcia
We have a a lot of new AE S wouldn't hurt to be put it on the chat box.
0:4:12.840 --> 0:4:13.790
Speaker 1
Absolutely, yeah.
0:4:13.210 --> 0:4:13.900
+19037800999
To see I have a.
0:4:12.760 --> 0:4:22.970
Adrian Garcia
So and and just to remind everybody, we have we have, I mean I call them jobbies, but we have a full a resource area and sell in the SharePoint.
0:4:22.980 --> 0:4:25.60
Adrian Garcia
You know that that walks through all the changes.
0:4:25.70 --> 0:4:30.820
Adrian Garcia
How to submit you know and create quotes so you know always, always have that handy.
0:4:31.30 --> 0:4:35.320
Adrian Garcia
I think sometimes you guys forget because we've normally not had a resource like that.
0:4:36.400 --> 0:4:36.790
+19037800999
Adrian.
0:4:36.610 --> 0:4:37.70
Speaker 1
Absolutely.
0:4:36.800 --> 0:4:37.250
+19037800999
And does she?
0:4:36.820 --> 0:4:37.450
Adrian Garcia
Just a reminder.
0:4:37.260 --> 0:4:38.630
+19037800999
I have a I have a question.
0:4:38.720 --> 0:4:43.260
+19037800999
I just what are the best practices for timelines for approval please?
0:4:46.370 --> 0:4:46.860
Speaker 1
It is.
0:4:46.940 --> 0:4:49.790
Speaker 1
Is this just related to the SE approval?
0:4:50.850 --> 0:4:51.980
+19037800999
Just I I mean it's fine.
0:4:51.990 --> 0:4:53.800
+19037800999
It could be the SE just the in.
0:4:53.950 --> 0:4:55.930
+19037800999
I would say the entire approval process as well.
0:4:58.430 --> 0:4:59.140
Adrian Garcia
So I mean I.
0:4:58.510 --> 0:5:5.110
Speaker 1
So I can't speak to the financial, but Adrian, can you speak to more of the on the initial piece of it?
0:5:4.100 --> 0:5:5.790
Adrian Garcia
Yeah, I don't know if we have.
0:5:6.70 --> 0:5:6.490
Adrian Garcia
I don't know.
0:5:6.500 --> 0:5:18.500
Adrian Garcia
We have like an actual printed SLA, but I would say for the most part it's, you know, half a day if it's a little bit longer than that, it's probably because we need a little bit more information or somebody's traveling.
0:5:18.510 --> 0:5:20.60
Adrian Garcia
But you know it shouldn't.
0:5:20.110 --> 0:5:24.870
Adrian Garcia
It shouldn't be longer than half a day on the financial side.
0:5:25.940 --> 0:5:32.40
Adrian Garcia
Now there's a couple more approvals that need to kind of go through that then then we might take a little bit longer.
0:5:32.50 --> 0:5:36.550
Adrian Garcia
Like if there's a price floor thing or something like that, I don't know, but it doesn't hurt for you.
0:5:36.600 --> 0:5:37.970
Adrian Garcia
Guys to shoot an email.
0:5:37.980 --> 0:5:42.430
Adrian Garcia
You know, after if you guys needed right then and there and you don't get it within an hour, it's OK.
0:5:42.440 --> 0:5:47.230
Adrian Garcia
It shouldn't email or shoot me a text or whoever it is that's it's assigned to.
0:5:48.140 --> 0:5:50.50
Adrian Garcia
Shouldn't be that difficult for us to get through that?
0:5:51.90 --> 0:5:52.740
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, you know, price, floor exceptions.
0:5:52.750 --> 0:5:55.600
Grant Sullivan
You know Bob and not generally try to have that under 4 hours.
0:5:56.90 --> 0:5:58.220
Grant Sullivan
I don't know if we've really gotten above that.
0:5:58.230 --> 0:6:10.40
Grant Sullivan
Maybe we have a couple of times, but we try to approve those right away and sales engineering approvals will just whatever time is normally required for them to do their job.
0:6:10.200 --> 0:6:11.820
Grant Sullivan
And the vet some stuff out.
0:6:11.830 --> 0:6:14.470
Grant Sullivan
So it just whatever normal time that you're seeing that.
0:6:14.550 --> 0:6:18.370
Grant Sullivan
And like Adrian said, the financial approvals, you know, talk pretty.
0:6:18.440 --> 0:6:18.720
Grant Sullivan
Quick with.
0:6:18.810 --> 0:6:18.870
Grant Sullivan
That.
0:6:20.30 --> 0:6:20.40
+19152033436
E.
0:6:20.410 --> 0:6:21.250
Grant Sullivan
If you need something right away.
0:6:21.730 --> 0:6:26.320
Adrian Garcia
And you know, keep practice there is just include notes and narrative. That always helps.
0:6:27.390 --> 0:6:27.600
Grant Sullivan
Yeah.
0:6:26.890 --> 0:6:28.860
Adrian Garcia
There's a few either rate with that.
0:6:28.870 --> 0:6:32.220
Adrian Garcia
There's a few of you get that are not consistent at all with that.
0:6:32.230 --> 0:6:38.120
Adrian Garcia
So if you put some notes around why you need the approval or whatever, that might be that, that's absolutely does help.
0:6:38.960 --> 0:6:39.630
Grant Sullivan
It does.
0:6:39.680 --> 0:6:39.970
Grant Sullivan
Uh.
0:6:39.980 --> 0:6:42.550
Grant Sullivan
Context around that is is very helpful.
0:6:42.660 --> 0:6:44.240
Grant Sullivan
You know, I do have seen some that come through.
0:6:44.250 --> 0:6:45.120
Grant Sullivan
It just says please approve.
0:6:46.550 --> 0:6:46.760
Adrian Garcia
Umm.
0:6:46.280 --> 0:6:53.770
Grant Sullivan
You know that's that's little ambiguous, but if you know, give us some reasons and and help us understand it, we won't have to give you a call and we can just approve and move forward.
0:6:56.210 --> 0:6:57.780
Jeremy Cox
So hey, this is this is Jeremy.
0:6:57.790 --> 0:7:12.540
Jeremy Cox
I would say with the sales engineering approval, you know there's gonna be some instances, you know, like if we if we didn't get early engagement and you guys put 100 gig wave on a quote and then submit it for approval don't don't expect that that day right that's that's not gonna happen.
0:7:12.550 --> 0:7:16.260
Jeremy Cox
That's probably coming back, and we're gonna have to have some conversations, you know, but if it's.
0:7:16.630 --> 0:7:21.210
Jeremy Cox
It's IP justification over 5 IP addresses and we just need to look at it and have a conversation that's different.
0:7:21.220 --> 0:7:21.680
Jeremy Cox
That's fast.
0:7:21.690 --> 0:7:28.240
Jeremy Cox
So early engagement on complicated products is going to be key this speed up your group crosses.
0:7:30.460 --> 0:7:31.60
Hayden Tuttle
Right and.
0:7:29.680 --> 0:7:32.400
Adrian Garcia
Yep, and and team, we're rolling out at time.
0:7:32.410 --> 0:7:35.830
Adrian Garcia
New products, I mean, I think we'll have some time for grant to kind of walk through.
0:7:35.940 --> 0:7:43.760
Adrian Garcia
But from now through the end of the year, you're gonna need to rely on your sales engineer, you know, to be able to get the specifics of the new products.
0:7:43.770 --> 0:7:44.500
Adrian Garcia
What it does do?
0:7:44.510 --> 0:7:48.360
Adrian Garcia
What it doesn't do that we can't really assume anything on these products.
0:7:48.370 --> 0:8:13.120
Adrian Garcia
We need to ensure that we're delivering the right expectations, so that's part of the reason why we're having, uh, you know that that we're we're including the sales engineering tasking because today we're not consistent across all markets engaging the sales engineer and by the time that we sell something, you know we might not be providing the best customer experience because you know they assume it does something that it necessarily does not, not does not do specific to the managed services.
0:8:13.130 --> 0:8:30.80
Adrian Garcia
I think I've seen some examples there, but it's really to be able to help elevate or offering and get everybody on the same page, and I think we're all committed to getting, you know, quick response around all of those things and all the new changes and in Salesforce.
0:8:32.760 --> 0:8:33.180
Adrian Garcia
Cool.
0:8:33.190 --> 0:8:33.580
Adrian Garcia
Sorry, man.
0:8:33.600 --> 0:8:34.350
Adrian Garcia
You gonna say something?
0:8:36.800 --> 0:8:37.110
Grant Sullivan
No.
0:8:36.740 --> 0:8:38.480
Adrian Garcia
OK, alright.
0:8:38.410 --> 0:8:38.870
Hayden Tuttle
Yeah, I'll.
0:8:38.880 --> 0:8:39.910
Hayden Tuttle
I was gonna say something.
0:8:38.490 --> 0:8:41.330
Adrian Garcia
So I'll I'll ohh go ahead, Wayne.
0:8:39.920 --> 0:8:45.450
Hayden Tuttle
Adrian, I what we, we we just gotta keep those lines of communication open.
0:8:47.510 --> 0:8:48.50
Rusty Wilson
The.
0:8:46.380 --> 0:8:48.270
Hayden Tuttle
And so it don't fire and forget.
0:8:49.690 --> 0:8:50.530
Hayden Tuttle
Go out there and.
0:8:48.460 --> 0:9:1.890
Hayden Tuttle
Don't just E submit the quote for approval by A or by SE and finance and just be like what's taking so long with my clothes, you know, have a conversation beforehand.
0:9:1.900 --> 0:9:3.220
Hayden Tuttle
I'm getting ready to submit this quote.
0:9:3.230 --> 0:9:4.280
Hayden Tuttle
You and I haven't talked about it.
0:9:4.330 --> 0:9:4.850
Hayden Tuttle
Just want to give you.
0:9:4.900 --> 0:9:12.630
Hayden Tuttle
A heads up, I know it's a little bit extra time, but it just makes the process go a lot smoother and it'll give you a lot quicker turn around.
0:9:14.90 --> 0:9:14.270
Adrian Garcia
Yep.
0:9:16.900 --> 0:9:17.300
Adrian Garcia
Alright.
0:9:16.520 --> 0:9:18.520
Speaker 1
Absolutely alright.
0:9:18.920 --> 0:9:19.160
Speaker 1
So.
0:9:19.240 --> 0:9:23.570
Speaker 1
Just E2 more quick updates.
0:9:23.680 --> 0:9:34.490
Speaker 1
They're kind of in the same as, you know, we have been working very diligently getting this new catalog about to come out soon.
0:9:34.760 --> 0:9:40.240
Speaker 1
And so you all would have seen a couple of different emails come out.
0:9:40.250 --> 0:9:44.620
Speaker 1
I appreciate all the ASM's and sales managers on the call. Who?
0:9:45.160 --> 0:9:48.290
Speaker 1
Make sure that we had the training schedule set up.
0:9:48.300 --> 0:10:2.820
Speaker 1
I appreciate that we do have 100% of the training scheduled for the new catalog, the CPQ sales force training and some people received an additional email This morning about UAT.
0:10:3.90 --> 0:10:6.460
Speaker 1
So I appreciate the ones who were volume told.
0:10:6.470 --> 0:10:7.920
Speaker 1
I appreciate you so much.
0:10:8.390 --> 0:10:11.980
Speaker 1
Just be on the lookout for those emails for UAT.
0:10:12.30 --> 0:10:23.560
Speaker 1
It's very important that we get this done so that we are able to give you all a a great product that hopefully has been moved to no bugs in it.
0:10:23.830 --> 0:10:35.880
Speaker 1
We all know is going to be a different type of behavior change when it comes to some of these new features, but we are definitely excited to to put them in front of the rural world.
0:10:35.890 --> 0:10:44.540
Speaker 1
Audience is going to be using it and to make sure that we're capturing any type of inefficiency or issues that may arise.
0:10:44.590 --> 0:10:48.100
Speaker 1
So the ones that are on the UAT team, I appreciate you.
0:10:48.230 --> 0:10:49.300
Speaker 1
I want to thank you in advance.
0:10:50.270 --> 0:10:55.780
Speaker 1
Because you know, without you, we wouldn't be able to really produce this to to production.
0:10:56.90 --> 0:11:16.960
Speaker 1
So those are the last two things I am getting a couple of emails about where the find the SOF no, I just wanted to make sure that you all know where to find the SOF and that is you know on that SharePoint site if other people are uploading them I would not recommend that.
0:11:16.970 --> 0:11:18.190
Speaker 1
That's the source of truth.
0:11:18.200 --> 0:11:26.340
Speaker 1
When that you use, make sure that you go to the one that's either uploaded is going to say my name or Judy's name, so.
0:11:26.390 --> 0:11:42.660
Speaker 1
We want to make sure that we're uploading whatever we get from from Grant's team or whatever that we're uploading the correct one for you all, because people can make changes and you think it may be the right one, but it's not if you don't know where that's at, I'm gonna put that in the chat as well.
0:11:42.670 --> 0:11:57.800
Speaker 1
Well, and so you know how to get back to that, if anyone does need assistance, please use applications that can tear.com no need to copy myself or Jeffrey on it, but just make sure that the subject line is clear.
0:11:58.560 --> 0:11:59.670
Speaker 1
That's all I have, Adrian.
0:12:1.490 --> 0:12:2.310
Adrian Garcia
Alright, thank you.
0:12:3.110 --> 0:12:3.970
Speaker 1
You're so welcome.
0:12:6.680 --> 0:12:6.990
Speaker 1
Ask.
0:12:3.480 --> 0:12:7.60
Adrian Garcia
I appreciate the partnership. OK.
0:12:7.70 --> 0:12:27.830
Adrian Garcia
So we're we're gonna go into the results and the recognition for those individuals over 100% and kind of where we are with the preliminary numbers through the first half of the year and then we'll we'll deed over to the rest of the ecosystem product and Jackie to give you guys some additional products, some additional updates on the product and marketing site.
0:12:27.840 --> 0:12:30.350
Adrian Garcia
So let's dig right in.
0:12:30.360 --> 0:12:34.300
Adrian Garcia
Can you guys see our my slide, you know if I'm already click share?
0:12:38.380 --> 0:12:48.690
Adrian Garcia
So First off, we wanted to acknowledge that our newest team members, we have several, you know that have come on board since May.
0:12:48.700 --> 0:12:49.880
Adrian Garcia
I might have missed a few.
0:12:49.890 --> 0:12:56.760
Adrian Garcia
I apologize if I did, but I think I captured most all super excited about next week.
0:12:56.770 --> 0:12:59.210
Adrian Garcia
We do have a new hire training class here in corporate.
0:12:59.220 --> 0:13:1.80
Adrian Garcia
Most of these individuals will be participating.
0:13:2.60 --> 0:13:2.590
Adrian Garcia
Uh.
0:13:2.620 --> 0:13:4.420
Adrian Garcia
Wanted to welcome Dominique Abbe.
0:13:4.430 --> 0:13:7.430
Adrian Garcia
We'll get to meet her in person next week.
0:13:7.440 --> 0:13:13.950
Adrian Garcia
She is a new account executive down next Texarkana for the another northern Louisiana sales team.
0:13:14.400 --> 0:13:22.370
Adrian Garcia
We have Mr Matt Jones out of San Angelo or the meeting him account executive in San Angelo working with Todd Smith.
0:13:22.380 --> 0:13:24.980
Adrian Garcia
Mr Christian Vega, El Paso.
0:13:24.990 --> 0:13:28.900
Adrian Garcia
We have 3 individuals, actually four at the rest of these are real Paso actually.
0:13:28.910 --> 0:13:32.700
Adrian Garcia
So we have quite a few new team members out of our passive market.
0:13:32.710 --> 0:13:40.500
Adrian Garcia
So Isaiah W comes to us from Spectrum VoIP I believe, and he's going to be part of Maribel's team.
0:13:40.510 --> 0:13:43.900
Adrian Garcia
Team Maribel is also our new sales manager in El Paso.
0:13:44.370 --> 0:13:47.320
Adrian Garcia
She will be working with Kirk Jefferson down.
0:13:47.330 --> 0:13:55.20
Adrian Garcia
There really focused on the smaller customers that transactional customers, small biz.
0:13:55.360 --> 0:14:2.950
Adrian Garcia
You know, she's building her team along with Isaiah W, who is coming to us from like, it says, Peckham Boyd and Rainer Mayer.
0:14:2.960 --> 0:14:6.820
Adrian Garcia
I think is also on the call and might might not have been.
0:14:6.830 --> 0:14:12.680
Adrian Garcia
I think you might start next week actually, but that we'll be able to meet him in training next week.
0:14:12.690 --> 0:14:17.580
Adrian Garcia
Mr Paul Cordova, our new sales engineer working with Hayden and supporting the full market.
0:14:18.250 --> 0:14:21.250
Adrian Garcia
Welcome to the team and again, Miss Maribel Mendez.
0:14:21.260 --> 0:14:25.80
Adrian Garcia
Senior she's been on board right about a month and a week.
0:14:25.90 --> 0:14:31.640
Adrian Garcia
I believe making an impact and planning to conquer the world or the second half of El Paso's world, I should say so.
0:14:32.70 --> 0:14:33.110
Adrian Garcia
So welcome, everybody.
0:14:34.510 --> 0:14:38.920
Adrian Garcia
Looking forward to meeting all of you next week, what we have a full agenda for you all.
0:14:39.550 --> 0:14:49.480
Adrian Garcia
Hope you guys bring lunch because we have nothing to eat for you guys, so we really wanted you guys to be on the edge of your seat and eager to eager to eager to listen.
0:14:49.490 --> 0:14:51.130
Adrian Garcia
But I'm kidding.
0:14:51.180 --> 0:14:55.820
Adrian Garcia
Alright, so through June again, you'll see.
0:14:55.830 --> 0:15:11.100
Adrian Garcia
You'll see probably snippets of spreadsheets and then some of the the sales flash, but through the end of June, with the preliminary numbers and again these are preliminary, these are out of Salesforce and these are manual that I kind of calculated and put together.
0:15:11.110 --> 0:15:20.400
Adrian Garcia
But overall for the enterprise organization we're sitting at about 73% for the year against our goal of 623,000.
0:15:20.410 --> 0:15:25.930
Adrian Garcia
We worried about 455 a E through June.
0:15:25.940 --> 0:15:28.470
Adrian Garcia
That is about a 15% year over year uptick.
0:15:29.520 --> 0:15:35.10
Adrian Garcia
We did have, you know, a few deals that pushed a few large deals that pushed into July.
0:15:35.20 --> 0:15:44.750
Adrian Garcia
One of those in Opaso that should make a significant needle move a that the team is really excited about working and and delivering.
0:15:44.760 --> 0:15:52.380
Adrian Garcia
I think they have a closing meeting next week I believe, but we did have several of those and we did bring a few other larger deals that will review.
0:15:53.440 --> 0:15:55.350
Adrian Garcia
I don't necessarily have a year to date through May.
0:15:55.360 --> 0:15:56.870
Adrian Garcia
I think that I'll just give you the June.
0:15:57.120 --> 0:15:57.940
Adrian Garcia
That's where we're at.
0:15:59.340 --> 0:16:8.350
Adrian Garcia
I'll dig into the individual markets and but you can see, you know, kind of where they're at from the year perspective and the forward looking slide.
0:16:8.360 --> 0:16:10.210
Adrian Garcia
So right here.
0:16:10.220 --> 0:16:14.890
Adrian Garcia
So the top number, that's our main number, this is the market breakout.
0:16:15.570 --> 0:16:24.60
Adrian Garcia
We had northern Louisiana at 138% through that month, if I'm not mistaken.
0:16:24.70 --> 0:16:35.0
Adrian Garcia
Northern Louisiana team hit 100% every month for seven or eight months, and they lost count, but it was a streak that I don't know if I've seen in the conterra before.
0:16:35.10 --> 0:16:43.400
Adrian Garcia
So I wanted to to give kudos to to Stephanie and Tim Burkes and the full northern Louisiana team for for doing a phenomenal job.
0:16:43.410 --> 0:16:46.680
Adrian Garcia
And there's a lot of things that are that are happening in that market.
0:16:46.690 --> 0:16:52.570
Adrian Garcia
The team I think I believe in that same month, every single individual in that team was over 100%.
0:16:52.800 --> 0:16:56.920
Adrian Garcia
So congratulations to you and to all the success through May.
0:16:57.570 --> 0:17:9.280
Adrian Garcia
Uh, you know next to that through May, we had, you know, Southern Louisiana to close 82% and then eastern North Carolina at 94% for June.
0:17:9.330 --> 0:17:14.670
Adrian Garcia
Again, these are the preliminary numbers with what is in sales force A.
0:17:15.200 --> 0:17:19.830
Adrian Garcia
The Northern Louisiana team remain at 124%.
0:17:20.420 --> 0:17:24.790
Adrian Garcia
They did not hit 100% for the month, so it did break their streak.
0:17:24.840 --> 0:17:41.550
Adrian Garcia
But they're still at the 124% for the year to date goal they had, you know it was a tough, it was a tough month and northern Louisiana East Texas region, we did have some significant outages and storms that impacted customers being available.
0:17:41.560 --> 0:17:53.470
Adrian Garcia
It impacted a lot of our team members as well in northern Louisiana and East Texas that had power outages and you know, luckily they they've been able to come out of that.
0:17:53.480 --> 0:17:58.370
Adrian Garcia
And I mean, it was about two weeks, I think that at least somebody had, you know, some level of power issues.
0:17:58.380 --> 0:18:8.210
Adrian Garcia
So tough, tough month, but at the same time some several of these deals did push into July for the month.
0:18:8.220 --> 0:18:14.590
Adrian Garcia
We had northern Louisiana, I mean, sorry, southern Louisiana hit 181%.
0:18:14.600 --> 0:18:17.650
Adrian Garcia
It was also a record breaking month for them.
0:18:18.80 --> 0:18:20.190
Adrian Garcia
In June, they heard 30,000.
0:18:20.700 --> 0:18:25.900
Adrian Garcia
30,099 believe it's almost $30,100.
0:18:25.910 --> 0:18:32.290
Adrian Garcia
So they had a really large deal come through that they've been working to bring in.
0:18:32.300 --> 0:18:49.570
Adrian Garcia
We'll, we'll talk a little bit more about that, but they had, you know, pretty much everybody contribute to that success or congratulations to the southern Louisiana, Kirk and Andrew, he has been working on some of those opportunities for a while and and we're able to navigate them to bring them in.
0:18:49.580 --> 0:19:0.170
Adrian Garcia
So overall, I mean again, we're sitting at about 73% team, that puts Southern Louisiana just four points shy of being at 100% for the year.
0:19:0.180 --> 0:19:5.610
Adrian Garcia
If you saw the the top there, they were about 80% eighty 2% for the year.
0:19:5.620 --> 0:19:11.290
Adrian Garcia
So they're that one month was able to get them, you know, trued up to close to 100%.
0:19:11.300 --> 0:19:19.470
Adrian Garcia
So again, we have a significant funnel and and larger opportunities that we're pushing that are going into the second half of the year.
0:19:19.480 --> 0:19:28.210
Adrian Garcia
So we're a little bit behind, but we're all driven to hit that number and we all have the right team, you guys, the new team members will be reviewing also their performance.
0:19:28.220 --> 0:19:34.30
Adrian Garcia
But the new team members, they challenge all of you to to, you know, put numbers on the board as soon as you can.
0:19:34.40 --> 0:19:44.600
Adrian Garcia
I mean, we've had we've had several AE that hit in the thousands their first month we have you know, I don't know if I remember the actual number, but we've had a lot of successes here with with our new team members.
0:19:44.650 --> 0:19:52.990
Adrian Garcia
You know, contributing to that early early alright, so 100% for 100% club for May.
0:19:54.300 --> 0:19:56.950
Adrian Garcia
Uh and I broke this up like I did last time.
0:19:56.960 --> 0:19:59.870
Adrian Garcia
Kind of into three different segments.
0:20:0.440 --> 0:20:3.10
Adrian Garcia
I'm I'm highlighting the individuals that are on ramp.
0:20:3.20 --> 0:20:15.230
Adrian Garcia
So we have, we normally have tenured and non tenured, but I'm highlighting the ones that are actually unwrapped, meaning they're transitioning into the company, building their funnel and having success in May.
0:20:15.290 --> 0:20:22.120
Adrian Garcia
Andrew, within his second month, was able to achieve over his ramp quota at 136%.
0:20:22.490 --> 0:20:28.120
Adrian Garcia
Mr Kevin Dunn and Ken Flores weren't able to hit the ramp, but they did contribute, which is important, right?
0:20:28.130 --> 0:20:35.310
Adrian Garcia
It's not easy to be able to contribute your first or second month and to see to see you guys already moving the needle.
0:20:35.320 --> 0:20:42.210
Adrian Garcia
We want to acknowledge that that's great to see for our account executives, not seniors.
0:20:42.520 --> 0:20:47.870
Adrian Garcia
We have Mr Cody Foster on top at 230% attainment.
0:20:47.880 --> 0:20:52.190
Adrian Garcia
You had a phenomenal month in May, $5700 on the board.
0:20:52.540 --> 0:21:10.440
Adrian Garcia
Second, in attainment is just Chris Kasprzak and I believe that might be his first time at 100% for the month, which is great to see his success and he's building on his on his funnel and seconded that Mister Brandon Gaines at 189.
0:21:10.550 --> 0:21:14.780
Adrian Garcia
You said also part of the East, North Carolina team, Courtney Meadows.
0:21:15.290 --> 0:21:36.30
Adrian Garcia
I believe that this is her first month off of ramp in May, she was able to achieve her above her quota at 110% and then Miss Amy Villemarette and she's she's on this list often 2562 hundred and 2% and then Mr Paul Robertson at 25 with by a dollar he get 100%.
0:21:36.40 --> 0:21:38.280
Adrian Garcia
So way to go. Uh Paul.
0:21:38.290 --> 0:21:42.900
Adrian Garcia
Way to drive if it was, if it was $1.00 that needed to get you there, $2.00 and needed to get you there.
0:21:42.910 --> 0:21:43.680
Adrian Garcia
Congratulations.
0:21:43.690 --> 0:21:44.560
Adrian Garcia
And you're assertiveness.
0:21:44.570 --> 0:21:57.430
Adrian Garcia
And pushing through that and then in the I did want to just mention Kimberly Moore as you were close 93%, but congratulations to those account executives and we move over to the right hand side for our seniors.
0:21:57.440 --> 0:22:2.260
Adrian Garcia
We have Mr Todd Smith as you might or might not know, he does carry a dual role.
0:22:2.270 --> 0:22:3.390
Adrian Garcia
He is a he.
0:22:3.400 --> 0:22:17.90
Adrian Garcia
Is the market leader for San Angelo, but he does have an individual contributor quota and he was able to bring in a fairly large deal that will review here a little bit later on with Novacomm, he was able to achieve $9100 against this quota.
0:22:17.100 --> 0:22:23.80
Adrian Garcia
It's 456% attainment and somebody that's not familiar in this.
0:22:23.90 --> 0:22:23.600
Adrian Garcia
Just kidding.
0:22:23.610 --> 0:22:30.460
Adrian Garcia
Miss Kristie McCormick uh 317% way to go.
0:22:30.580 --> 0:22:31.560
Adrian Garcia
Todd Christie.
0:22:31.570 --> 0:22:33.520
Adrian Garcia
Phenomenal to see that level of attainment.
0:22:45.10 --> 0:22:45.130
Blake Gunn
Yeah.
0:22:33.530 --> 0:22:50.0
Adrian Garcia
Mr Rusty Wilson comes in at 184% for May $6400 on the board and Rusty Bunton we had a rusty and Rusty square 3800 dollars, 111% attainment and Mr Brent Marvel at 3:30.
0:22:50.10 --> 0:23:2.490
Adrian Garcia
724 hundred, 6% congratulations to all of you for May and those results, uh, you know a lot of you frequent frequent Flyers in this club and that's great to see what it is.
0:23:2.500 --> 0:23:6.730
Adrian Garcia
Also, a few of you that are that are able to get on this, so congratulations to all.
0:23:7.740 --> 0:23:10.90
Adrian Garcia
Let's go over to June preliminary now.
0:23:10.100 --> 0:23:21.850
Adrian Garcia
Again, this is from Salesforce and you can see it have couple of blanks in there so you know dismissed that Mister Dagan $9600 against the quota of $2500.
0:23:22.140 --> 0:23:26.830
Adrian Garcia
That was part of a deal that he partnered with Andrew Taylor on.
0:23:26.840 --> 0:23:31.430
Adrian Garcia
But it was significant month for him 388%.
0:23:31.740 --> 0:23:41.560
Adrian Garcia
Paul Robertson again at 100 and 331% he had a very large deal come in on the last two days of the month or maybe even the last day of the month.
0:23:41.610 --> 0:23:42.860
Adrian Garcia
I don't know is a Buzzard beater.
0:23:43.740 --> 0:23:50.680
Adrian Garcia
He was able to get that through and then Kade Doss great to see Mr Kade on this list.
0:23:50.910 --> 0:23:52.370
Adrian Garcia
Phenomenal month Kade.
0:23:52.380 --> 0:24:1.60
Adrian Garcia
I know you've been working hard to get to get there and great to see you've heard a lot of great things about what you did to get there from your leadership.
0:24:1.70 --> 0:24:5.250
Adrian Garcia
So phenomenal month for you to get on this list and look at this, Mr Chris Kasprzak.
0:24:5.850 --> 0:24:6.300
Blake Gunn
Woo Hoo.
0:24:5.690 --> 0:24:9.330
Adrian Garcia
Once again, 109% way to go creates 2 months in a row.
0:24:10.320 --> 0:24:12.350
Adrian Garcia
Phenomenal to see that again.
0:24:12.360 --> 0:24:14.110
Adrian Garcia
Forget about the Lord 2 numbers.
0:24:14.120 --> 0:24:30.710
Adrian Garcia
That's just typos, and for our seniors, Mr Andrew Taylor, as you can, as I mentioned, he did work with Dagan, both of them partnered on Calcasieu Parish Sheriff, and we're successful in bringing in a 17 site network.
0:24:31.450 --> 0:24:39.220
Adrian Garcia
I was lucky enough to be able to participate in some of those meetings in person and on the phone and and they really did have a a partnership going.
0:24:39.230 --> 0:24:39.600
Adrian Garcia
It was.
0:24:39.870 --> 0:24:44.120
Adrian Garcia
It was really awesome to see, you know how they navigated the conversations between both of them.
0:24:45.310 --> 0:24:50.20
Adrian Garcia
You know how they were peered with individuals across the the table.
0:24:50.30 --> 0:24:58.860
Adrian Garcia
You know, one with the CIO and the other one with the network administrator, they were both really mindful of the conversations that were taking place and executing so phenomenal job.
0:24:58.870 --> 0:25:8.580
Adrian Garcia
Andrew and Dagan, great to see you 267%, Mr Rusty Wilson once again on this list, 145% Sean Griffin.
0:25:9.190 --> 0:25:10.180
Adrian Garcia
Look at that guy.
0:25:10.250 --> 0:25:13.160
Adrian Garcia
Look at that guy $4600.
0:25:13.170 --> 0:25:16.10
Adrian Garcia
You can say 134% and look at this.
0:25:16.100 --> 0:25:21.940
Adrian Garcia
Another rusty, rusty square shows up $4000 a 116%.
0:25:21.950 --> 0:25:22.790
Adrian Garcia
He called me yesterday.
0:25:22.800 --> 0:25:27.180
Adrian Garcia
He goes hey, are you didn't acknowledge me and Jim because I was at 100% both of those months.
0:25:27.190 --> 0:25:28.40
Adrian Garcia
Did you know that? And you?
0:25:28.50 --> 0:25:28.460
Adrian Garcia
Absolutely.
0:25:28.470 --> 0:25:28.810
Adrian Garcia
I knew that.
0:25:29.900 --> 0:25:31.150
Adrian Garcia
Congratulations, rusty.
0:25:31.160 --> 0:25:31.740
Adrian Garcia
Great to see you.
0:25:31.750 --> 0:25:38.30
Adrian Garcia
And Nancy Berger hitting the list 3800 dollars, 111% phenomenal job is Nancy.
0:25:38.580 --> 0:25:47.770
Adrian Garcia
And then for those that are on ramp, we didn't have anybody hit the ramp quota, but we did have individuals on the board, Andrew, third month in $100.
0:25:48.160 --> 0:25:51.450
Adrian Garcia
Hey I know I've seen the funnel you're building upon that funnel it all.
0:25:51.700 --> 0:25:54.150
Adrian Garcia
It's going to come in, Mr Matt Jones.
0:25:54.160 --> 0:25:57.50
Adrian Garcia
I think it was one week on the job $30.00.
0:25:57.60 --> 0:26:11.320
Adrian Garcia
I don't know exactly what that might have been, but it was a transfer from from Todd to deal with something that, but at the end of the day it's it's it's on the board looking forward to meeting you, Mr Camp Flotus and Willie McGee, also on the board, a way to go, team.
0:26:11.330 --> 0:26:17.820
Adrian Garcia
I know it's all about building that funnel, so every little success will contribute towards momentum.
0:26:17.830 --> 0:26:23.740
Adrian Garcia
So, great job for all of those that are at 100% for those two months.
0:26:23.750 --> 0:26:31.700
Adrian Garcia
Unfortunately, I do not have a true up for the year, simply because they're out of time and simply because I it's just I have to do manual.
0:26:32.170 --> 0:26:33.390
Adrian Garcia
So I owe you that.
0:26:33.400 --> 0:26:42.300
Adrian Garcia
I'm looking forward to the the news, the the sales flash coming from finance and they'll make sure that we acknowledge all of the all of you that are at 100% for the year.
0:26:43.90 --> 0:26:51.700
Adrian Garcia
I could deal through manage results for that, but it might have changed so this is me just trying to get the call consistency and trying to get to the acknowledgement.
0:26:51.710 --> 0:26:56.270
Adrian Garcia
But I did want to pivot over into these larger deals that we've won the last two months.
0:26:56.280 --> 0:27:7.130
Adrian Garcia
We've had some E really nice wins and I'll probably pick on the sales managers or the area sales managers to to talk about the success or kind of what, what it took to win these deals.
0:27:7.140 --> 0:27:14.860
Adrian Garcia
But in in May, which is the top half of the slide, the largest deal that we sold was novacom.
0:27:14.870 --> 0:27:22.830
Adrian Garcia
And again, this is a this is an opportunity that Jeff and Todd and Jeremy have been working on for well over six months.
0:27:23.180 --> 0:27:24.610
Adrian Garcia
It's it's died down.
0:27:24.620 --> 0:27:35.280
Adrian Garcia
It's going back to life and you know it's a it's a pretty unique opportunity in West Central Texas that that Todd was successful in winning.
0:27:35.290 --> 0:27:43.310
Adrian Garcia
So Keith and Todd, do you guys want to talk about what it is that we solve for and what what differentiated does that allow us to win this partnership?
0:27:44.920 --> 0:27:45.660
Keith Lloyd
Don't get him, Todd.
0:27:47.420 --> 0:27:48.230
Todd Smith
I'll take this.
0:27:49.460 --> 0:27:49.770
Todd Smith
Yeah.
0:27:49.780 --> 0:27:51.410
Todd Smith
So it's in a the small community.
0:27:51.420 --> 0:27:56.910
Todd Smith
Ballinger, TX and if you anybody knows Ballinger, Texas, there's just not much there.
0:27:57.740 --> 0:28:6.350
Todd Smith
Umm, we happen to have our own fiber for region 15, school district, about 900 foot away from them.
0:28:6.940 --> 0:28:12.740
Todd Smith
And so novacom they're they're a multi faceted kind of business.
0:28:14.410 --> 0:28:16.320
Todd Smith
There are OK.
0:28:17.90 --> 0:28:30.220
Todd Smith
Anyway, they they have their their housing, some servers for EA Sports, their housing, some servers for Colorado University, and they're doing much more.
0:28:30.230 --> 0:28:31.160
Todd Smith
But they're looking.
0:28:31.210 --> 0:28:32.810
Todd Smith
They're looking for huge bandwidth.
0:28:32.820 --> 0:28:35.750
Todd Smith
They're ordered a 10 gig circuit right off the bat.
0:28:36.580 --> 0:28:37.190
Todd Smith
Umm.
0:28:38.130 --> 0:28:43.290
Todd Smith
And looking to go to 100 gig and maybe larger sooner than later.
0:28:44.900 --> 0:28:45.950
Todd Smith
Not only that, did they?
0:28:45.960 --> 0:28:48.750
Todd Smith
They ordered the guy that is the owner.
0:28:48.760 --> 0:28:54.270
Todd Smith
Manager lives in Ballinger and he had a he has a house on a County Road.
0:28:55.620 --> 0:29:8.410
Todd Smith
We had to Type 2 that location because we were nowhere near nowhere near it, but he has a 10 year old son who is a genius and his 10 year old son is doing coding his 10 year old son is.
0:29:8.460 --> 0:29:8.730
Todd Smith
Doing.
0:29:10.0 --> 0:29:15.790
Todd Smith
A lot of things that that are way above my head and so his son needs some bandwidth.
0:29:15.800 --> 0:29:22.170
Todd Smith
So he ordered a 5 gig circuit for his house, which is we don't care if it's a.
0:29:22.240 --> 0:29:22.390
Todd Smith
House.
0:29:22.500 --> 0:29:23.830
Todd Smith
Or a business we're gonna get in.
0:29:24.40 --> 0:29:25.270
Todd Smith
Get in some bandwidth.
0:29:25.990 --> 0:29:31.460
Todd Smith
Umm, so that's where that's this started with a actually actual absolute cold call.
0:29:31.470 --> 0:29:32.310
Todd Smith
We were.
0:29:32.370 --> 0:29:40.330
Todd Smith
I was driving back from Dallas, saw the banner on the on the fence and just stopped in and said hello and that's how it started.
0:29:43.240 --> 0:29:44.740
Adrian Garcia
So you mean the cold call?
0:29:44.970 --> 0:29:45.700
Adrian Garcia
Call's work.
0:29:45.950 --> 0:29:46.460
Adrian Garcia
Wow.
0:29:46.870 --> 0:29:47.940
Todd Smith
Very cold call, yeah.
0:29:47.710 --> 0:29:48.490
Adrian Garcia
Amazing.
0:29:48.720 --> 0:29:51.380
Adrian Garcia
Amazing way to go, Todd.
0:29:51.550 --> 0:29:52.680
Adrian Garcia
Congratulations to you.
0:29:52.690 --> 0:29:53.80
Adrian Garcia
Phenomenal.
0:29:53.90 --> 0:29:58.810
Adrian Garcia
I think it's the largest win out of the San Angelo area, so congratulations, that's a record breaking deal for you.
0:29:59.540 --> 0:29:59.860
Todd Smith
Thank you.
0:30:0.190 --> 0:30:9.550
Adrian Garcia
You know, looking forward to continued success and I'll I'll group may and June based on on markets I wanted, Stephanie and her team to talk a little bit about Willis Knighton.
0:30:9.560 --> 0:30:17.110
Adrian Garcia
And I know it's an existing account, but it's been a long, long conversation and a lot of effort.
0:30:17.170 --> 0:30:25.580
Adrian Garcia
And to get this through and also you could discuss a little bit about cattle, parish Sheriff's Office in May cause that was a significant win as well.
0:30:25.590 --> 0:30:29.630
Adrian Garcia
So, Miss Stephanie Green and and Tim Burke and you guys talked about these two opportunities.
0:30:30.480 --> 0:30:31.270
Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure.
0:30:31.280 --> 0:30:35.970
Speaker 2
Willis Knighton was it's it's a long play, strategic type of account.
0:30:36.20 --> 0:30:45.140
Speaker 2
We set the standard by a Tim designed them a private network solution back when law was was there.
0:30:45.150 --> 0:30:51.430
Speaker 2
Rep and Christy took over the account and and got in there and just went full blast.
0:30:51.440 --> 0:30:53.450
Speaker 2
You know what do you love about conterra?
0:30:53.460 --> 0:30:58.840
Speaker 2
What can we do to be better and started talking to them about upgrading the existing network that we had?
0:30:59.830 --> 0:31:4.0
Speaker 2
And so Kristie, even in that process uncovered additional opportunity.
0:31:4.10 --> 0:31:14.600
Speaker 2
So a lot of the revenue, well, $3000 of their revenue on this order was adding Internet circuits that they had with somebody else that they weren't even considering with us.
0:31:14.610 --> 0:31:19.740
Speaker 2
She uncovered that opportunity and even extended the contract they had.
0:31:19.950 --> 0:31:22.130
Speaker 2
They had three years left of the contract.
0:31:22.140 --> 0:31:27.820
Speaker 2
She extended it two more years for a total revenue, $12,100 a month.
0:31:28.920 --> 0:31:29.300
Adrian Garcia
What's your?
0:31:27.830 --> 0:31:36.310
Speaker 2
So, umm, she did a really good job securing the bag, uncovering additional opportunities, pulling in the sales engineer.
0:31:36.860 --> 0:31:50.830
Speaker 2
I think the most important part of it, and Kristie process and and what makes her successful is she never leaves a meeting without setting the follow up meeting and the next steps and getting it on the calendar, getting it accepted by the customer.
0:31:50.840 --> 0:32:2.960
Speaker 2
So that in my mind is something that everybody can do to drive deals forward and making sure that you're keeping a regular cadence with the customer it.
0:32:2.970 --> 0:32:6.90
Speaker 2
I mean, it keeps us on track too and gives us something to work for.
0:32:7.20 --> 0:32:16.490
Speaker 2
Something else Christy does is on these larger strategic deals she she sets an internal call with the team to make sure that we're all on the same page.
0:32:16.500 --> 0:32:21.730
Speaker 2
We all know what our role is and and and how we can play together.
0:32:21.740 --> 0:32:23.630
Speaker 2
So we do a lot of good cop, bad cop.
0:32:25.870 --> 0:32:33.320
Speaker 2
We we let Tim handle the technical discussions and there's more opportunity to come from Willis Knighton.
0:32:33.370 --> 0:32:46.410
Speaker 2
And because there's, uh, sorry because of how responsive she is and because of how on top of things and organized she is she she's really, really successful.
0:32:46.420 --> 0:32:49.830
Speaker 2
So and any chance you have to pick her brain?
0:32:49.900 --> 0:32:53.390
Speaker 2
Do it because she she's really great at what she does.
0:32:53.400 --> 0:32:55.750
Speaker 2
And so I gotta give it to her.
0:32:55.820 --> 0:32:59.570
Speaker 2
And on the Tim, do you wanna say anything about Willis 9?
0:32:59.580 --> 0:33:0.560
Speaker 2
Do you have anything to add?
0:33:2.720 --> 0:33:13.110
Timothy Burks
I mean, just speaking to the cadence, it's really been key for us, you know, cause Gee and and the team, I've been doing a great job at getting us in front of the people.
0:33:13.120 --> 0:33:21.780
Timothy Burks
We need to be talking to, even if it doesn't start out that way, and I think that allows me and Stephanie to really come in.
0:33:21.790 --> 0:33:38.90
Timothy Burks
Stephanie's great at, you know, starting the right conversations, getting the right questions to ask and and it really leads to the customer telling us they're paying points throughout the conversation easier, making it easier for the customer to, you know, identify that even when they're not thinking about things that we could do for them.
0:33:38.940 --> 0:33:52.460
Timothy Burks
Umm, because you know when we're coming into their office, they're looking at us as another provider versus being an actual partner where we can actually plug in and places they they're not, you know, may not even be aware of.
0:33:53.300 --> 0:33:58.970
Timothy Burks
So you know, Kristie, putting us in front of the right people, keeping us on that cadence cadence.
0:33:58.980 --> 0:34:2.570
Timothy Burks
And like Stephanie said, you know, keeping our integrity internal.
0:34:3.340 --> 0:34:25.250
Timothy Burks
Uh, on point and then us being able to go in and have those conversations and uncover the the things that we are the way we are is is really decadence behind it and Kristie keeps us on top of that team, keeps us on top of that as far as me and Stephanie playing a key role and and being support for their deals that they they set up for us to be in front of so.
0:34:26.640 --> 0:34:36.910
Speaker 2
Yeah, some big parts of that, like Kristie, talks a lot about being partners and about creating long lasting partnerships with with all the people that we support.
0:34:37.20 --> 0:34:39.740
Speaker 2
It's not just about getting a sale today.
0:34:39.790 --> 0:34:51.990
Speaker 2
It's about setting ourselves up for the future and really being that the chosen provider, so she she does a really great job of that and also understanding the buying process.
0:34:52.0 --> 0:34:53.650
Speaker 2
What's the sense of urgency?
0:34:53.720 --> 0:34:55.850
Speaker 2
Or do we need to create a sense of urgency?
0:34:57.330 --> 0:34:59.300
Speaker 2
What's their decision making process?
0:34:59.310 --> 0:35:4.340
Speaker 2
So we can accurately forecast and and know if we can count that deal for this month or not.
0:35:4.400 --> 0:35:15.770
Speaker 2
So as far as Caddo Parish Sheriff's Office, that one kinda goes into what was said about Novacom.
0:35:15.780 --> 0:35:20.980
Speaker 2
A cold call is coal calls are still alive and well.
0:35:22.740 --> 0:35:31.690
Speaker 2
There was a third party, like a master agent that made a coal call to Caddo Parish Sheriff's Department.
0:35:31.940 --> 0:35:33.850
Speaker 2
We already serve Caddo Parish.
0:35:34.140 --> 0:35:40.930
Speaker 2
We didn't realize that the Sheriff's Department was a separate entity that pays their own bill and buys their own solutions.
0:35:41.80 --> 0:35:50.70
Speaker 2
So this random guy from New York made a coal call and the customer said, well, we're actually looking for quotes right now for dark fiber.
0:35:50.300 --> 0:35:57.260
Speaker 2
And they spent about a month trying to collect quotes for them just so they could get paid.
0:35:57.270 --> 0:35:57.860
Speaker 2
Right.
0:35:58.30 --> 0:36:3.220
Speaker 2
And then they they called us because the customer said, well, conterra is in here.
0:36:3.230 --> 0:36:4.40
Speaker 2
You ought to call them.
0:36:4.50 --> 0:36:5.660
Speaker 2
We, that's who we were gonna call.
0:36:6.610 --> 0:36:11.120
Speaker 2
And so they called us, not expecting us to respond to the bid.
0:36:11.210 --> 0:36:15.440
Speaker 2
But Paul instantly said, you know what, we have a lot of questions to ask you.
0:36:15.450 --> 0:36:19.980
Speaker 2
We need to get our engineer involved with the when somebody asks for dark fiber.
0:36:19.990 --> 0:36:32.120
Speaker 2
Normally it's a finance decision or a network design decision, and so we needed to really understand why did they ask for what they asked for and and understand the the true need of the customer.
0:36:32.250 --> 0:37:5.20
Speaker 2
So Paul did a great job getting that call set up, getting Tim in front of the customer and even where that partner didn't have the answers to our questions, we were able to bring the customer in and and get the answers to what we needed and even secure the buy in and ask them straight up to sign this month because you guys heard that my my team faced every sort of bad thing that that could be thrown at us last month from family members.
0:37:5.30 --> 0:37:6.860
Speaker 2
My my father in law was in ICU.
0:37:6.870 --> 0:37:8.900
Speaker 2
I had health issues.
0:37:9.570 --> 0:37:11.340
Speaker 2
We had no power.
0:37:11.410 --> 0:37:23.580
Speaker 2
We had every single ball that could be thrown at us was thrown at us and so this was the hell, Mary end of the month and and Paul was all over it.
0:37:23.670 --> 0:37:25.420
Speaker 2
And so he saved the day.
0:37:25.550 --> 0:37:49.300
Speaker 2
Really and truly with the 8051 dollar five year deal and that partner, by the way was selling against us trying to get them to buy from AT&T because AT&T paid them more and because of Paul and his specific actions, we were able to win a deal that if it was up to that partner, we wouldn't know one even though they wanted to get paid on it.
0:37:50.880 --> 0:37:51.220
Adrian Garcia
Let's see.
0:37:49.970 --> 0:37:59.0
Timothy Burks
And and we were able to talk to customer out of the dark fiber solution over to a private network, I think was a win ultimately.
0:37:59.990 --> 0:38:0.710
Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure.
0:38:0.980 --> 0:38:3.780
Adrian Garcia
Good. Awesome.
0:38:0.210 --> 0:38:5.670
Speaker 2
Was getting that conversation changed around because they didn't really want dark fiber, but the cold?
0:38:5.730 --> 0:38:12.670
Speaker 2
Call is still alive, y'all and don't let these partners and these other people that are getting paid residuals cold.
0:38:12.680 --> 0:38:16.730
Speaker 2
Call your customer first because a lot of times that they get in there first and we're out.
0:38:18.380 --> 0:38:18.780
Adrian Garcia
Right.
0:38:18.840 --> 0:38:21.580
Adrian Garcia
So one one more call, right.
0:38:21.900 --> 0:38:23.990
Adrian Garcia
So congratulations, Christy.
0:38:24.80 --> 0:38:25.110
Adrian Garcia
Stephanie Paul.
0:38:25.220 --> 0:38:28.480
Adrian Garcia
Tim, great job and we'll have one more.
0:38:28.490 --> 0:38:37.310
Adrian Garcia
I know there's a lot on this list, but we'll have one more team kind of review their success and like to have Kirk Bertus and his team talk about Calc issue.
0:38:38.270 --> 0:38:40.20
Adrian Garcia
Uh Parish Sheriff's Office.
0:38:40.30 --> 0:38:46.360
Adrian Garcia
But we had two the sheriff's in northern Louisiana and in the larger counties that we support partner up with us.
0:38:46.370 --> 0:38:47.390
Adrian Garcia
So that's phenomenal to see.
0:38:48.280 --> 0:38:49.740
Adrian Garcia
Uh, where?
0:38:49.820 --> 0:38:51.330
Adrian Garcia
Take it away and talk to us. About what?
0:38:51.380 --> 0:38:51.950
Adrian Garcia
What?
0:38:52.80 --> 0:38:53.450
Adrian Garcia
What were the differentiators?
0:38:53.460 --> 0:38:54.390
Adrian Garcia
Why did they choose conterra?
0:38:56.70 --> 0:38:56.990
Kirk Bertus
Umm good deals.
0:38:57.0 --> 0:39:8.620
Kirk Bertus
So this sale was headed off by Andrew Taylor and Dagan, Soileau Targan and a new area of the Lake Charles the the north, the northern side of Calcasieu.
0:39:9.230 --> 0:39:11.420
Kirk Bertus
This also was a Co called Cold Call.
0:39:11.480 --> 0:39:17.190
Kirk Bertus
It was perfect timing when they approached the Sheriff's Office, they had an existing aerial network.
0:39:17.330 --> 0:39:19.160
Kirk Bertus
They had been through multiple storms.
0:39:18.890 --> 0:39:19.240
Adrian Garcia
Healthcare.
0:39:19.170 --> 0:39:20.690
Kirk Bertus
The service wasn't reliable.
0:39:21.950 --> 0:39:36.340
Kirk Bertus
It had left them completely out for a number of months, so to get a better understanding of our network and our capabilities, Dagan and Andrew went in there and built the trust they identified who the proper stakeholders were.
0:39:36.630 --> 0:39:38.700
Kirk Bertus
Throughout this discussion discussion.
0:39:38.750 --> 0:39:39.380
Kirk Bertus
But who?
0:39:39.390 --> 0:39:44.940
Kirk Bertus
The ultimate decision maker makers were and who they would influence through that conversation.
0:39:45.30 --> 0:39:50.110
Kirk Bertus
We worked with the sales engineer to put together A-17 site location.
0:39:50.700 --> 0:39:54.570
Kirk Bertus
Two of those were Type 2, the rest were on net.
0:39:54.580 --> 0:39:55.690
Kirk Bertus
It had diversity.
0:39:55.700 --> 0:39:56.30
Kirk Bertus
It had.
0:39:56.40 --> 0:40:3.330
Kirk Bertus
Sip it had redundant paths and we worked everything on the back end, through the executives, through the HIO process.
0:40:3.820 --> 0:40:6.900
Kirk Bertus
We alerted all of the E executives.
0:40:6.910 --> 0:40:14.580
Kirk Bertus
What the capital costs would be, we got the buy in from the top and when we went and pitched our solution, we pitched A5 year.
0:40:14.690 --> 0:40:16.220
Kirk Bertus
It met out the CapEx.
0:40:16.280 --> 0:40:35.580
Kirk Bertus
It gave us a ton of new network to sell within that region that will gain once the network is built on additional customers passed and just a really big win for SLA that came uh right after Andrew Taylor had also the month prior had sold the copper shoe clerk of courts.
0:40:35.640 --> 0:40:37.710
Kirk Bertus
So we're getting a lot of traction within that market.
0:40:38.540 --> 0:40:42.30
Kirk Bertus
These are the type of key accounts that really make a difference in the market.
0:40:42.40 --> 0:40:51.70
Kirk Bertus
They speak to the community, they're great representatives of of conterra and really appreciate the relationship that we've established so far.
0:40:51.460 --> 0:40:54.870
Kirk Bertus
So more to come from SLA.
0:40:55.630 --> 0:40:56.500
Adrian Garcia
Was was that?
0:40:56.640 --> 0:40:58.760
Adrian Garcia
Was that the one that said to the to be true?
0:40:58.770 --> 0:41:1.900
Adrian Garcia
Because I know that was part of, I guess or obstacle, right?
0:41:1.970 --> 0:41:4.131
Adrian Garcia
Was that was that that the 1E?
0:41:4.380 --> 0:41:5.290
Andrew Taylor
No, that was a different one.
0:41:3.430 --> 0:41:22.880
Kirk Bertus
Well, that, that that's actually another client that hit had mentioned that and you know part of our biggest challenge is is just getting the name out who can Tara is and how long we've been in the market, what our story is when we get to that point of the discussion, we actually show them the network and our capabilities.
0:41:23.390 --> 0:41:28.20
Kirk Bertus
That response does come a lot is like we've never heard of you.
0:41:28.200 --> 0:41:28.640
Kirk Bertus
Wow.
0:41:28.650 --> 0:41:30.710
Kirk Bertus
You know, it's almost too good to be true.
0:41:31.450 --> 0:41:41.160
Kirk Bertus
And so, you know, when other success story really look forward to more great work from the team on Landon that sale.
0:41:41.940 --> 0:41:43.260
Andrew Taylor
That I just want to say something.
0:41:43.270 --> 0:41:44.0
Andrew Taylor
This is Andrew Taylor.
0:41:42.430 --> 0:41:45.150
Adrian Garcia
They were team Andrew.
0:41:45.760 --> 0:41:53.780
Andrew Taylor
So we sent an email, basically code call email at 11:11 AM saying hey we're can Sarah.
0:41:54.70 --> 0:41:57.810
Andrew Taylor
Ohh, I'd like to meet with you 22 minutes later.
0:41:58.270 --> 0:42:2.500
Andrew Taylor
They responded with dates that they could meet and we knew it was all on.
0:42:2.510 --> 0:42:5.250
Andrew Taylor
We were like, alright, let's go and we just went as fast as we did.
0:42:6.230 --> 0:42:6.670
Adrian Garcia
Awesome.
0:42:7.180 --> 0:42:7.420
Adrian Garcia
Yeah.
0:42:7.430 --> 0:42:8.130
Adrian Garcia
And I, you know, I was.
0:42:8.140 --> 0:42:16.80
Adrian Garcia
It was again, you know, part of those conversations you guys had a plan, you guys had a back back down plan and you guys were In Sync.
0:42:16.90 --> 0:42:23.890
Adrian Garcia
So the nominal job team way to go, we could spend all call kind of going through these deals and maybe that's an idea for related on roads.
0:42:23.900 --> 0:42:29.290
Adrian Garcia
I think we learn from each other's best practices approach strategies across all the markets.
0:42:29.300 --> 0:42:40.430
Adrian Garcia
So we should we could spend a little bit more time, but I do want to make sure I transition and give Grant and his team and Jackie and the team, you know the time that they that they need to be able to review these things.
0:42:40.440 --> 0:42:44.620
Adrian Garcia
But again, phenomenal, a movement and success.
0:42:44.630 --> 0:42:50.800
Adrian Garcia
I mean, these are all new logos for the most part, these conversations are taking place in all of our markets.
0:42:51.230 --> 0:42:53.260
Adrian Garcia
It's similar conversations.
0:42:53.310 --> 0:43:4.480
Adrian Garcia
It's the same power statement right that we're communicating to the team, so I encourage everyone to see the success that we have within these deals and apply to what you guys are doing out in the field.
0:43:4.490 --> 0:43:7.960
Adrian Garcia
We bring a ton of value to our prospects and customers.
0:43:8.890 --> 0:43:17.900
Adrian Garcia
We're one of the few companies in these markets that are up against the established telecom trend of, you know, diluted customer service and experience.
0:43:17.910 --> 0:43:21.450
Adrian Garcia
Nobody's local, so team this is these are perfect examples.
0:43:21.460 --> 0:43:28.280
Adrian Garcia
Reach out to each other, collaborate, talk about the successes, talk about the challenges, because this is where the rubber meets the borrow.
0:43:28.290 --> 0:43:29.130
Adrian Garcia
This is what we're doing.
0:43:29.140 --> 0:43:29.900
Adrian Garcia
This is conterra.
0:43:29.910 --> 0:43:32.930
Adrian Garcia
So phenomenal job across the board team.
0:43:32.970 --> 0:43:33.330
Adrian Garcia
Way to go.
0:43:34.400 --> 0:43:41.300
Adrian Garcia
They believe that is all I have for the recognition and we, you know, remind her.
0:43:41.310 --> 0:43:45.680
Adrian Garcia
I believe Michael has his quarterly recognition that will include the full quarter.
0:43:45.550 --> 0:43:45.710
Matt Jones
It's.
0:43:47.320 --> 0:43:52.60
Adrian Garcia
I think it's this month later this month and the second the last week of the month to check the calendars.
0:43:52.70 --> 0:43:58.450
Adrian Garcia
It should already be there things that 24th while confirmed before the end of the call, but we'll have the rest of the team.
0:43:58.460 --> 0:44:10.130
Adrian Garcia
I know that the the E rate and wholesale team are on, so I apologize team that you guys have kind of have to wait through this, but well, we're going to get compared and measured against all of you and Michael's call.
0:44:10.140 --> 0:44:10.410
Adrian Garcia
Call.
0:44:10.420 --> 0:44:12.30
Adrian Garcia
So I look forward to that.
0:44:12.40 --> 0:44:13.910
Adrian Garcia
So thank you all.
0:44:14.0 --> 0:44:15.860
Adrian Garcia
I'll transition over to Mr Grant.
0:44:16.550 --> 0:44:17.170
Adrian Garcia
Take it away, Sir.
0:44:18.610 --> 0:44:19.530
Grant Sullivan
Alright, I appreciate it.
0:44:19.540 --> 0:44:24.330
Grant Sullivan
Jackie, are we ready to to do product or do you have something that you want to talk about before we start?
0:44:25.740 --> 0:44:26.810
Grant Sullivan
Not OK.
0:44:26.160 --> 0:44:27.780
Jacquelyn Llorca
No, you're good.
0:44:27.900 --> 0:44:31.10
Grant Sullivan
Alright, well I'm going to pass it over to Bob.
0:44:31.80 --> 0:44:31.830
Grant Sullivan
Bob, are you on?
0:44:31.840 --> 0:44:32.370
Grant Sullivan
I think you are.
0:44:33.400 --> 0:44:34.60
Robert Ruggiero
I am. Yes.
0:44:34.720 --> 0:44:35.500
Grant Sullivan
Alright, take it away, Sir.
0:44:36.10 --> 0:44:49.100
Robert Ruggiero
All right, I'm going to share my screen here and bear with me while I put this in presentation mode because you guys probably don't wanna do the eye chart that's sitting right here and we'll hopefully this slide show start from the beginning.
0:44:49.570 --> 0:44:50.60
Robert Ruggiero
Awesome.
0:44:50.410 --> 0:44:52.160
Robert Ruggiero
So I'm cross.
0:44:52.170 --> 0:44:54.200
Robert Ruggiero
You guys can actually see my screen and you can hear me.
0:44:55.300 --> 0:44:59.610
Robert Ruggiero
I I see a a corner of my screen up here with a nodding yes.
0:45:0.140 --> 0:45:0.340
Grant Sullivan
You're.
0:44:59.620 --> 0:45:3.290
Robert Ruggiero
So let's say yes to me there are three things that we're going to cover today.
0:45:3.920 --> 0:45:5.390
Robert Ruggiero
Three things that I'm excited about.
0:45:5.400 --> 0:45:8.710
Robert Ruggiero
Hopefully I'll get you guys really excited about we have managed Gateway.
0:45:8.780 --> 0:45:24.20
Robert Ruggiero
We have managed LAN which will spend a whole bunch of time on and then we have a a managed deed also offering that I'm going to leak out to you, but we need to be aware of and we're going to start moving, umm heavily towards that.
0:45:24.30 --> 0:45:25.890
Robert Ruggiero
But those are three things we're gonna talk about today.
0:45:25.900 --> 0:45:29.970
Robert Ruggiero
So let's get it away and start off with the managed gateway.
0:45:30.200 --> 0:45:34.230
Robert Ruggiero
If you guys are looking at this, you may be looking at the screen thinking what is the managed gateway.
0:45:34.970 --> 0:45:41.60
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, I believe it or not, you guys are probably fairly familiar with what the gateway is, so think about it today.
0:45:41.70 --> 0:45:52.530
Robert Ruggiero
In today's world, when you actually sell a voice line, excuse me to a customer that's not a hosted line, but a voice line to a customer that wants to connected to a traditional TDM or ego analog service.
0:45:52.540 --> 0:46:0.640
Robert Ruggiero
So a A, you know, old school PBX or old school Keith system, it's an analog service.
0:46:1.270 --> 0:46:11.160
Robert Ruggiero
We need to do something in order to provide a voice service to them, so we provide voice as a as a customer, we provide our carrier, we provide IP signaling.
0:46:11.290 --> 0:46:12.660
Robert Ruggiero
That's how we provide service.
0:46:13.20 --> 0:46:16.360
Robert Ruggiero
Analog doesn't know what to do with IP signaling.
0:46:16.370 --> 0:46:18.560
Robert Ruggiero
You got to put something in there to actually convert it.
0:46:18.620 --> 0:46:36.380
Robert Ruggiero
That's where the gateway is, so it's installed the customers prems connected to the analog equipment and it converts that IP signal from carrier, which is what we do today to TDM or an analog so that somebody can pick up the phone, the old school phone say times Ty and make me make connections.
0:46:36.990 --> 0:46:40.690
Robert Ruggiero
So in this context, we are actually offering this as a managed service.
0:46:40.700 --> 0:46:43.120
Robert Ruggiero
So it is a piece of equipment and we'll get that into a second.
0:46:43.430 --> 0:46:47.730
Robert Ruggiero
And what we're doing with this piece of equipment is we're gonna, we're gonna provide the configuration for it.
0:46:47.910 --> 0:46:51.260
Robert Ruggiero
We're gonna provide the management for it and we're going to provide updates to us.
0:46:51.270 --> 0:46:56.830
Robert Ruggiero
So if we have to update firmware, etcetera, that's what we're going to be doing from.
0:46:57.940 --> 0:47:0.510
Robert Ruggiero
I skipped over quickly, but this is a you know this is a quick thing.
0:47:0.520 --> 0:47:1.750
Robert Ruggiero
There will be Flyers available.
0:47:1.760 --> 0:47:5.70
Robert Ruggiero
I think I I don't know the link off top of my head.
0:47:5.80 --> 0:47:8.100
Robert Ruggiero
I'm sure that we can put it into the chat room, but there is a lot flatter bill.
0:47:8.110 --> 0:47:17.430
Robert Ruggiero
But if you guys would look at the basically the pitch here will be you want to keep that voice Gateway running off and leave fully compliant from a compliance 6 standpoint.
0:47:17.440 --> 0:47:35.730
Robert Ruggiero
You know, some of the smaller customers may not have the compliance and regulations that a larger customers do, but you know as a as a person that runs in network or it you know manager, you're compelled to actually do things like make sure of the firmware on any particular piece of equipment that touches your network is up to date.
0:47:35.740 --> 0:47:37.490
Robert Ruggiero
So there's security patches, etcetera.
0:47:37.740 --> 0:47:40.960
Robert Ruggiero
Those are things that we're going to be doing for the customer and that piece of equipment.
0:47:41.470 --> 0:47:45.900
Robert Ruggiero
We also do the provisioning, change management will monitor the hardware.
0:47:46.250 --> 0:47:50.670
Robert Ruggiero
This is something that is specifically specifically associated with voice lines.
0:47:50.680 --> 0:48:5.850
Robert Ruggiero
So again, when you guys go out there and talk to a customer, customer says, hey, I want voice service and at some point in time, you're not able to convince them to go away from the utilizing their E they're boat anchor PBX and moving to host it.
0:48:6.360 --> 0:48:13.290
Robert Ruggiero
If you can't convince them to do that, and you go right with a analog line, this is a piece of equipment that needs to go with that, right.
0:48:13.300 --> 0:48:21.380
Robert Ruggiero
So in this scenario, if you're selling customer, they won't go hosted, they have to they say no, I really want to stay with with analog handoff.
0:48:22.880 --> 0:48:26.930
Robert Ruggiero
You're required to actually add one of these devices per location.
0:48:26.940 --> 0:48:34.840
Robert Ruggiero
You sell a voice line at whether it's one line, whether it's 10 lines, whether 15 lines, if it's a location you're required to have one of them on there.
0:48:35.30 --> 0:48:37.890
Robert Ruggiero
This comes with a $15 per month MRC.
0:48:38.910 --> 0:48:40.900
Robert Ruggiero
I just was redundant with what I said.
0:48:40.970 --> 0:48:43.640
Robert Ruggiero
It's a $15 MRC, umm.
0:48:44.20 --> 0:48:51.320
Robert Ruggiero
And again, any time you sell 1 voice lines, if there's a location, you gotta have one at least one of these available at $15.00 a month.
0:48:52.990 --> 0:48:58.580
Robert Ruggiero
If you're like most people, and hopefully this actually works and you're looking at the screen, you're draw it over to the right hand of the screen.
0:48:58.590 --> 0:49:0.680
Robert Ruggiero
Cause I put this nice little thing up there, it said.
0:49:0.690 --> 0:49:2.380
Robert Ruggiero
Limited time only to draw your attention?
0:49:3.270 --> 0:49:26.110
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, so between now and probably the end of the month when we actually released a new catalog, you get the wonderful opportunity of being able to take a gateway that's supposed to be $15.00 a month and just model then with the voice lines and sell the benefit of the customer to the bus customer that this is the gateway.
0:49:26.120 --> 0:49:27.310
Robert Ruggiero
This is what we're going to do for you.
0:49:27.320 --> 0:49:28.90
Robert Ruggiero
Give them the select.
0:49:28.100 --> 0:49:40.230
Robert Ruggiero
Talk to him about it and then provide it to him for free and you get to do that for about a month and at the end of the month when we get into the new catalog, we'll talk about how we can you structure things differently.
0:49:40.360 --> 0:49:47.970
Robert Ruggiero
But, but right now I want you guys to understand that when you go out there and sell voice, you're not able to convince somebody to go to host it.
0:49:48.480 --> 0:49:52.330
Robert Ruggiero
They wanna stick with their they want to keep their old analog system up and running.
0:49:52.500 --> 0:49:56.560
Robert Ruggiero
They want a line that you have to include one of these within the order.
0:50:0.70 --> 0:50:10.680
Robert Ruggiero
So good weighed a pause for questions and before I move on to the next grouping, so I don't see any in the chat window.
0:50:10.690 --> 0:50:13.780
Robert Ruggiero
But then I have a little baby window off to the side, so.
0:50:15.500 --> 0:50:15.650
Todd Smith
Hey.
0:50:17.170 --> 0:50:17.700
Robert Ruggiero
No.
0:50:15.310 --> 0:50:17.820
Grant Sullivan
You do have a hand raised here, Bob couple.
0:50:17.750 --> 0:50:18.280
Robert Ruggiero
Awesome.
0:50:18.490 --> 0:50:20.160
Robert Ruggiero
So I see that's yes.
0:50:18.860 --> 0:50:28.880
Todd Smith
Hey Bob is there, is there a UPS included in this gateway battery backup, no.
0:50:26.210 --> 0:50:32.410
Robert Ruggiero
Uh, there is not a UPS including the gateway, so I'll move on to the next one and I'll keep with the questions go.
0:50:33.330 --> 0:50:35.80
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah, it's not a UPS it.
0:50:35.90 --> 0:50:36.90
Robert Ruggiero
It's actually a little box.
0:50:36.210 --> 0:50:46.390
Robert Ruggiero
Some if I have the pick, it's it's pretty small, but it that way, but it can be plugged into a UPS with the customer would have to provide that.
0:50:50.70 --> 0:50:50.410
Todd Smith
Thank you.
0:50:48.830 --> 0:50:51.60
Doug Boberg
He Bob is through placing the ADTRAN.
0:50:53.880 --> 0:50:54.360
Robert Ruggiero
Yes.
0:50:54.370 --> 0:50:57.490
Robert Ruggiero
So if it's an analog service, it replaces the Adrian.
0:50:57.500 --> 0:51:15.240
Robert Ruggiero
So right now, you know, as we speak, the ad Tran will still be in existence, will still put at trans out there, but specifically for specifically for SIP handoffs and for customers that that need a PRI handoff and that's the only place to get trans will still exist.
0:51:17.120 --> 0:51:17.610
Doug Boberg
OK.
0:51:17.700 --> 0:51:18.60
Doug Boberg
Thank you.
0:51:18.620 --> 0:51:18.800
Robert Ruggiero
Yep.
0:51:24.10 --> 0:51:30.420
Robert Ruggiero
Oh, I would go into a lot more detail in terms of the quantity of FXS ports, which are voice lines it'll support.
0:51:31.150 --> 0:51:51.60
Robert Ruggiero
I'm going to share that with you because if you go back and said and looked at the limited time only, it's included umm we you know when we get to the new catalog, there will be business rules that will help it make super simple and easy for you to not have to worry about how many gateways are required with how many voice lines I sold.
0:51:51.690 --> 0:51:59.580
Robert Ruggiero
So we don't have to go into that, that gory detail now, but you just from an awareness standpoint, this is the device that's going to go out there.
0:52:0.10 --> 0:52:10.590
Robert Ruggiero
You can actually use this as well as the E uh the the one pair 2 pager the jet that Jack and the marketing team produced for the Managed Gateway.
0:52:11.300 --> 0:52:23.490
Robert Ruggiero
You can use those as as leave behinds the talking points to customers as an additional benefit, I'm and again it up until the up until the new catalogs released, which will be sometime in beginning of August, it's just gonna be included.
0:52:23.500 --> 0:52:29.650
Robert Ruggiero
So they get a they get a $15 per month benefit if they sign a contract between now and August.
0:52:30.910 --> 0:52:31.340
Robert Ruggiero
Alright.
0:52:31.450 --> 0:52:32.730
Robert Ruggiero
Any any other questions?
0:52:32.740 --> 0:52:33.580
Robert Ruggiero
I got one more. I think.
0:52:33.590 --> 0:52:36.810
Robert Ruggiero
Tracy Vincent raised a hand and now it's gone. Yeah.
0:52:35.520 --> 0:52:36.930
Tracy Vincent
Ohh can yeah.
0:52:36.980 --> 0:52:41.790
Tracy Vincent
Ohh well, this backup on our work on the failover services that we have.
0:52:43.440 --> 0:52:49.480
Robert Ruggiero
Work in the so the gateway itself you can actually plug the gateway into.
0:52:50.840 --> 0:52:58.50
Robert Ruggiero
Umm yeah, you could plug it into the failover is there.
0:52:58.60 --> 0:52:59.900
Robert Ruggiero
They're they're pretty well separate though Tracy.
0:53:5.720 --> 0:53:6.10
Tracy Vincent
Umm.
0:52:59.910 --> 0:53:9.360
Robert Ruggiero
I mean this, this is something that will that that does the the analog to digital conversion, umm, so they're they're definitely separate offerings.
0:53:11.740 --> 0:53:12.970
Tracy Vincent
But I know they were separate offers.
0:53:13.210 --> 0:53:13.490
Robert Ruggiero
You.
0:53:12.980 --> 0:53:15.470
Tracy Vincent
I just wanted to keep with it, offer a backup.
0:53:15.480 --> 0:53:17.840
Tracy Vincent
Fell over in the relation to the voice service.
0:53:23.650 --> 0:53:23.810
Tracy Vincent
OK.
0:53:19.120 --> 0:53:25.90
Robert Ruggiero
Yes, yes, because it will, it will work the same way it would be for hosted, right.
0:53:37.750 --> 0:53:37.980
Tracy Vincent
OK.
0:53:25.100 --> 0:53:39.200
Robert Ruggiero
So you have to just, you know, dig in a little bit with your SE and how that would be designed or whether it's could be how it's going to be hanging off the, the, the the router or the OR the managed last witch, Yep.
0:53:39.830 --> 0:53:40.220
Rusty Wilson
So.
0:53:48.70 --> 0:53:49.360
Robert Ruggiero
Umm Yep.
0:53:40.350 --> 0:53:56.860
Rusty Wilson
So Bob, if if they just have, let's say they have hosted and they just need one fax line like pharmacy, I have to add 5050 another $15 item on top of the 19, whatever dollars that analog phone is.
0:53:58.400 --> 0:53:59.630
Robert Ruggiero
That that is correct.
0:53:58.180 --> 0:54:1.210
Rusty Wilson
Is that correct? OK.
0:54:4.900 --> 0:54:5.290
Rusty Wilson
No.
0:54:5.820 --> 0:54:6.490
Rusty Wilson
Yeah.
0:54:6.660 --> 0:54:7.70
Rusty Wilson
OK.
0:54:7.130 --> 0:54:9.101
Rusty Wilson
And the 625 E.
0:54:12.340 --> 0:54:12.630
Robert Ruggiero
The.
0:54:12.80 --> 0:54:13.150
Blake Gunn
Hey Bob, this is Blake.
0:54:13.200 --> 0:54:25.470
Blake Gunn
I just quick question, just for education purposes, what's the added value and be a $15 up charge versus the nine OAD to this product.
0:54:25.560 --> 0:54:30.140
Blake Gunn
What can we tell customers is different as to why we're adding this on?
0:54:31.960 --> 0:54:35.510
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah, there's a couple of things that are different just from the awareness standpoint.
0:54:36.20 --> 0:54:41.20
Robert Ruggiero
So with this device, we are actually going to be we're going to be monitoring and updating firmware.
0:54:41.810 --> 0:54:47.460
Robert Ruggiero
Umm the 908 E is something that we just put out there and and drop and and forget about it, right?
0:54:47.470 --> 0:54:56.510
Robert Ruggiero
It's basically it continues to work, but we're not updating firmware for uh for patches at all would just it's a set and forget.
0:54:57.80 --> 0:55:5.460
Robert Ruggiero
So there's some benefit here from a customer standpoint and you know that's that's the core difference.
0:55:6.100 --> 0:55:6.651
Blake Gunn
At the E.
0:55:5.470 --> 0:55:22.650
Robert Ruggiero
I mean in, in selfishly from an organization standpoint and for you guys perspectives, we spend probably about umm no lie 100 times more No 10 times more 10 times more 4908 E then we do this device.
0:55:24.160 --> 0:55:24.530
Blake Gunn
Understood.
0:55:24.320 --> 0:55:33.0
Robert Ruggiero
Alright, So what you guys will see, you'll see a benefit on your on the, you know, things turning red, yellow or green.
0:55:33.730 --> 0:55:37.400
Robert Ruggiero
You'll see that immediately because the cost of this is much lower.
0:55:37.630 --> 0:55:42.270
Robert Ruggiero
So your profitability flags will turn green a lot sooner.
0:55:44.90 --> 0:55:44.590
Robert Ruggiero
That makes sense.
0:55:44.260 --> 0:55:44.790
Blake Gunn
Perfect.
0:55:45.260 --> 0:55:45.720
Blake Gunn
Thank you, Sir.
0:55:45.340 --> 0:55:51.190
Robert Ruggiero
The but E so that was an easy one.
0:55:52.480 --> 0:55:53.650
Robert Ruggiero
I wanted to get to the fun ones.
0:55:53.660 --> 0:55:56.430
Robert Ruggiero
If you guys don't have questions about the managed gateway.
0:55:56.440 --> 0:55:58.170
Robert Ruggiero
I'll get to the one that I think is the most fun.
0:55:59.900 --> 0:56:0.90
Jorge Barrera
Yes.
0:55:58.220 --> 0:56:0.530
Robert Ruggiero
It's managed LAN alright.
0:55:58.510 --> 0:56:1.170
Adrian Garcia
There's there's one more, I believe, Jorge. Yeah.
0:56:1.360 --> 0:56:1.800
Robert Ruggiero
OK cool.
0:56:1.520 --> 0:56:12.940
Jorge Barrera
Yes, a question do we need to have this when we are in a new analog line or the system, Salesforce will recognize that we need it and added automatically.
0:56:14.340 --> 0:56:14.600
Robert Ruggiero
No.
0:56:15.990 --> 0:56:31.380
Robert Ruggiero
So in today's world, I'll, I'll refrain go back to the whole you know it's it's, it's included for free for next month when we get to the new CPQ environment which will be in August release, it'll do it for you up until now you probably need to remember it.
0:56:31.470 --> 0:56:35.120
Robert Ruggiero
I don't expect you guys to add it as a product on the order.
0:56:35.770 --> 0:56:48.350
Robert Ruggiero
That's something that's added when we actually go through the sales order form process, but as an AE, you wouldn't have to worry about this for a month.
0:56:48.410 --> 0:56:53.560
Robert Ruggiero
I other than it exists, it's a benefit, was talked to customer about how this is a benefit to them.
0:56:53.570 --> 0:57:0.650
Robert Ruggiero
They're getting a $15.00 a month free service because they're doing this in July, is post August.
0:57:2.50 --> 0:57:3.50
Robert Ruggiero
Hope that answered your question.
0:57:6.800 --> 0:57:7.110
Adrian Garcia
Yeah.
0:57:7.120 --> 0:57:9.550
Adrian Garcia
And if I could, if I could add a little bit to that.
0:57:9.560 --> 0:57:28.190
Adrian Garcia
So, you know, back to Blake's question, you know, I think I think we've been pretty consistent, not even mentioning the power of our voice network when we deliver a converge, a converted service, right, you know, pots lines are it's it's old technology.
0:57:28.380 --> 0:57:31.270
Adrian Garcia
I mean it's it's copper based technology.
0:57:31.330 --> 0:57:44.750
Adrian Garcia
If our competitors selling pots line and a true pots line, they're selling an old technology and this is basically our saying, hey, we're able to emulate this older technology if you don't want to invest in our hosting environment.
0:57:45.220 --> 0:57:57.810
Adrian Garcia
But we're also able to guarantee and ensure that it's delivered the way that it's supposed to be, and I think I think we need to kind of change the conversation just, you know, from just assuming that every carrier can deliver pots lines.
0:57:57.820 --> 0:58:1.640
Adrian Garcia
But you know, we're in the digital world now.
0:58:1.650 --> 0:58:6.700
Adrian Garcia
We need to be able to educate our customers a differences and this is an opportunity for us to be able to do that.
0:58:6.710 --> 0:58:16.970
Adrian Garcia
And you know, if AT&T or the local exchange carrier, whoever might be, is providing plain old telephone lines, additional plain old telephone, they're going to rack rates right now at $50.00 a line.
0:58:17.800 --> 0:58:39.660
Adrian Garcia
So we just have to be able to, you know, think about the value and not and and and kind of read train ourselves and saying hey, you know we're we're emulating older technology because you're not wanting to go and consider the hosting environment sort of speak right and this is part of us being able to guarantee and monitoring and make sure that it's worth way that you need it to be.
0:58:39.730 --> 0:58:41.570
Adrian Garcia
So just wanted to add that note.
0:58:48.820 --> 0:58:53.170
Robert Ruggiero
Oh, so I'm gonna move over to the next the thing I think this is the most fun.
0:58:53.180 --> 0:58:58.450
Robert Ruggiero
This is the most exciting for me at least, so hopefully hopefully you catch on my excitement here.
0:58:59.740 --> 0:59:3.710
Robert Ruggiero
So I'm we're gonna talk about managed land and yeah.
0:59:3.720 --> 0:59:7.30
Robert Ruggiero
Believe it or not, you can be looking at the just thinking what is man's land?
0:59:7.90 --> 0:59:7.550
Robert Ruggiero
What is it?
0:59:7.560 --> 0:59:17.150
Robert Ruggiero
I've never had an experience it with it before, but managed line is basically is an Ethernet switch connecting conterra provided devices and custom as well as customer provided devices.
0:59:18.720 --> 0:59:30.770
Robert Ruggiero
Anytime you guys go out there today and today's world and you sell a hosted voice solution, you sell hosted voice, see and you sell a A a phone IP phone that goes along with it, right?
0:59:30.880 --> 0:59:53.380
Robert Ruggiero
Every time that happens, we provide a managed switch or before I switch out there, some people might refer to it as a Poe switch, but it's basically an Ethernet switch and we do that so that we can do because provisioning and configuration or those phones to hook to something that's Poe that can cook back into our network.
0:59:53.390 --> 0:59:57.920
Robert Ruggiero
So we we do it because of the because we need to have that functionality.
0:59:58.190 --> 0:59:59.280
Robert Ruggiero
Think of it this way.
0:59:59.370 --> 1:0:24.360
Robert Ruggiero
Any customer that you walked into today in today's world that has either IP phones, maybe they have a printer, maybe they have multiple server stacks within their business environment, they have an Ethernet switch, they connect things, wired computer devices together, they disperse, they have a they provide you know some sort of security.
1:0:24.370 --> 1:0:25.610
Robert Ruggiero
They provide routing protocols.
1:0:25.620 --> 1:0:32.610
Robert Ruggiero
They provide things to allow those devices to talk to each other within, within the land environment, right.
1:0:32.700 --> 1:0:38.570
Robert Ruggiero
And a lot of times those companies will provide will actually hire somebody outside to manage those switches.
1:0:38.660 --> 1:0:50.70
Robert Ruggiero
Maybe they'll do it themselves, and I think anytime you talk to anybody 9/2 side about, you know, yeah, managing switches, they'll tell you it's a pain in the, in the rear, they'll do it.
1:0:50.130 --> 1:0:50.990
Robert Ruggiero
So necessary evil.
1:0:51.0 --> 1:0:58.500
Robert Ruggiero
They don't like doing it, so using this as a managed service is something is a big benefit in this managed land scenario.
1:0:58.790 --> 1:1:3.400
Robert Ruggiero
Contera now is going to be providing those Ethernet switches for the customers.
1:1:3.630 --> 1:1:39.80
Robert Ruggiero
We can continue to use them to connect container provided services like IP phones like umm you know forward extenders that I sold the wireless failover that Ford extender used to plug into something that's Ethernet switch to provide futuristic things maybe like a like you know API's for Wi-Fi, but it's also be able to support customer provided things that we don't sell like maybe the customer needs to connect their Canon printer I into their network or maybe they need to connect their VM stack into the network.
1:1:39.150 --> 1:1:47.220
Robert Ruggiero
So that's switching itself is something that we would be able to provide as a service to customers provided as a managed service.
1:1:47.230 --> 1:1:53.460
Robert Ruggiero
And the customer then can then cannot have to rely on either their internal resources to manage that splits or outsource it.
1:1:53.470 --> 1:1:55.550
Robert Ruggiero
So that's something they can rely on conterra to do.
1:1:56.240 --> 1:2:4.810
Robert Ruggiero
Again, this is a lot of new territory for you guys because I think for the most part, y'all are focusing on things that are router.
1:2:5.670 --> 1:2:6.960
Robert Ruggiero
No ultra network.
1:2:6.970 --> 1:2:8.420
Robert Ruggiero
Not from Broward, not router.
1:2:8.430 --> 1:2:12.960
Robert Ruggiero
Inside the four walls, which is the lamp, there are some great information here.
1:2:13.240 --> 1:2:17.280
Robert Ruggiero
Again, I think this link is the right one.
1:2:17.290 --> 1:2:32.840
Robert Ruggiero
I will rely on Jackie and team to make sure that you guys have the right one, but there is a there is a nice little, you know, two page flyer to gives you the overviews of what it is kind of generally what I said and and yeah in in high level.
1:2:33.110 --> 1:2:35.360
Robert Ruggiero
But there's also this really cool white paper here.
1:2:35.890 --> 1:2:41.160
Robert Ruggiero
I'm not gonna click into it, but I will give you a how overview of exactly what it covers.
1:2:41.170 --> 1:2:48.80
Robert Ruggiero
So it's basically A2 pager that gives you a nice little tutorial on what is the Ethernet switch.
1:2:48.90 --> 1:2:49.80
Robert Ruggiero
Why is it important?
1:2:49.150 --> 1:2:49.660
Robert Ruggiero
Why?
1:2:49.710 --> 1:2:50.660
Robert Ruggiero
Why?
1:2:51.210 --> 1:2:53.990
Robert Ruggiero
Why do E you know?
1:2:54.0 --> 1:2:55.520
Robert Ruggiero
And users think as important work.
1:2:55.560 --> 1:3:3.60
Robert Ruggiero
Why does it exist and and you know what's managed versus unmanaged when it comes to an Ethernet switch?
1:3:3.70 --> 1:3:4.700
Robert Ruggiero
So it's a great little white paper.
1:3:5.590 --> 1:3:6.600
Robert Ruggiero
It's a 2 pager.
1:3:6.970 --> 1:3:8.190
Robert Ruggiero
I think it's an easy rate.
1:3:8.200 --> 1:3:10.820
Robert Ruggiero
You may, you may disagree with me, right?
1:3:10.960 --> 1:3:18.410
Robert Ruggiero
But it is available for you guys to look at and I would encourage you to go pull it up and just take a peek at it so that you're more comfortable with with what that land environment looks like.
1:3:18.420 --> 1:3:21.400
Robert Ruggiero
So you can start having that conversation with customers.
1:3:23.710 --> 1:3:23.970
Robert Ruggiero
So.
1:3:28.540 --> 1:3:43.860
Robert Ruggiero
Basically what we're doing here is we are going to be providing the provisioning configuration, change management and monitoring of those switches, right, so that Ethernet switch in the customer's network, we're going to be valued, provisioning configuration, change management and monitoring.
1:3:45.200 --> 1:3:46.570
Robert Ruggiero
I'm thinking 2 slides from now.
1:3:46.580 --> 1:3:58.150
Robert Ruggiero
We'll look at the monitoring, but there's a huge benefit here from a customer perspective because they don't have to do the gory things that from a management perspective, we're doing a lot of that stuff for them.
1:3:58.800 --> 1:4:12.310
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, so this is something that is generally available with one voice hosted and I'm gonna show you in a second when we pull Salesforce off and show you where you can pull it.
1:4:12.320 --> 1:4:20.340
Robert Ruggiero
Get it from, but generally available with host it right, because today's world is associated with hosted voice, doesn't need to be.
1:4:21.250 --> 1:4:35.520
Robert Ruggiero
But in today's world, for this particular month until the catalog new catalogs out there is associated with voice, cause you would sell it with, you would sell it with or be required with any hosted voice sale that you put out there, OK.
1:4:37.80 --> 1:4:41.580
Robert Ruggiero
There is a managed land business and there's a managed lent enterprise.
1:4:41.590 --> 1:4:43.990
Robert Ruggiero
I will tell you the difference to two of them in a second.
1:4:44.240 --> 1:4:50.350
Robert Ruggiero
It's basically the quantity of ports, but once $50.00 a month $175 a month.
1:4:51.280 --> 1:4:54.980
Robert Ruggiero
Umm I I personally think that's generally a bargain.
1:4:55.140 --> 1:4:56.730
Robert Ruggiero
It requires a managed router.
1:4:58.580 --> 1:5:17.780
Robert Ruggiero
The managed router is generally $30.00 a month and once again look at that on the right hand side you you get a benefit for a limited time only where if you guys select a managed LAN business switch for $50.00 that comes with a router.
1:5:19.950 --> 1:5:26.560
Robert Ruggiero
Though comes with a managed router, so I'll pause there and make sure everybody kind of understands what I said and if I have to say it.
1:5:26.570 --> 1:5:29.980
Robert Ruggiero
And yeah, different terms, but you guys.
1:5:34.160 --> 1:5:36.50
Robert Ruggiero
Like did I did I get my message across?
1:5:46.270 --> 1:5:46.950
Grant Sullivan
Deepest question.
1:5:43.550 --> 1:5:47.840
Robert Ruggiero
Like it's like I like silence, so yes.
1:5:51.530 --> 1:5:51.730
Robert Ruggiero
30.
1:5:52.870 --> 1:5:53.40
Keith Lloyd
Yeah.
1:5:53.50 --> 1:5:54.40
Keith Lloyd
Let me get off meet here.
1:5:54.50 --> 1:6:3.80
Keith Lloyd
OK, I'm looking at this and I'm trying to understand that you're saying that, uh, it's gonna require a four gate router in order to do a managed LAN.
1:6:4.160 --> 1:6:4.990
Keith Lloyd
Is that correct?
1:6:5.50 --> 1:6:5.250
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:6:3.730 --> 1:6:5.790
Robert Ruggiero
Yep, that is correct.
1:6:10.520 --> 1:6:11.80
Robert Ruggiero
That's correct.
1:6:6.730 --> 1:6:16.600
Keith Lloyd
And the managed router is $30.00 a month and the land business switch is $50.00 or enterprise that $75.00 right?
1:6:17.80 --> 1:6:17.270
Robert Ruggiero
Yep.
1:6:20.170 --> 1:6:20.370
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:6:20.180 --> 1:6:21.30
Robert Ruggiero
And that open.
1:6:20.160 --> 1:6:25.170
Blake Gunn
So normally 80 but 75 is a discounted rate, right?
1:6:25.530 --> 1:6:26.300
Blake Gunn
If you're doing it.
1:6:25.830 --> 1:6:26.780
Keith Lloyd
It's normally 80.
1:6:27.840 --> 1:6:28.260
Robert Ruggiero
No.
1:6:28.480 --> 1:6:29.380
Blake Gunn
50 + 30.
1:6:30.700 --> 1:6:32.950
Keith Lloyd
Now that's for an Lt managed.
1:6:28.830 --> 1:6:33.410
Robert Ruggiero
Yes, you have plus 30, no.
1:6:32.960 --> 1:6:35.400
Keith Lloyd
That's a LTE backup there, right?
1:6:38.880 --> 1:6:39.680
Keith Lloyd
Routers 30.
1:6:36.500 --> 1:6:43.890
Robert Ruggiero
Routers 30 managed land switches last last switches 50 right so.
1:6:42.20 --> 1:6:43.890
Keith Lloyd
OK, very good. OK.
1:6:44.610 --> 1:6:46.530
Robert Ruggiero
Umm normally 80.
1:6:48.220 --> 1:6:49.250
Keith Lloyd
Normally 80.
1:6:49.690 --> 1:6:50.130
Keith Lloyd
How's that?
1:6:50.140 --> 1:6:50.840
Keith Lloyd
Normally 80.
1:6:49.790 --> 1:6:52.710
Robert Ruggiero
Right, 30 + 30 is 80.
1:6:54.170 --> 1:6:54.570
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:6:55.400 --> 1:6:55.800
Robert Ruggiero
Right.
1:6:55.880 --> 1:6:57.60
Robert Ruggiero
So the router is just the router.
1:6:58.300 --> 1:7:0.190
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah, it doesn't include anything else.
1:7:1.660 --> 1:7:1.910
Keith Lloyd
Umm.
1:7:0.200 --> 1:7:2.230
Robert Ruggiero
It's just the router and now it.
1:7:6.900 --> 1:7:7.160
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:7:2.240 --> 1:7:7.430
Robert Ruggiero
Now it has managed LAN switch associated with it, so that's $80.00 umm.
1:7:7.610 --> 1:7:15.20
Robert Ruggiero
So between now and whenever the new catalog releases, the router is free, so the router is 0.
1:7:15.960 --> 1:7:18.30
Keith Lloyd
OK, gotcha. OK.
1:7:17.440 --> 1:7:22.380
Robert Ruggiero
So in in theory you can go out to the customer and I'm gonna kick myself for saying this.
1:7:22.390 --> 1:7:24.30
Robert Ruggiero
But I know you're gonna know you're gonna do this.
1:7:24.40 --> 1:7:26.770
Robert Ruggiero
And I'm not gonna Ding you for doing this.
1:7:26.840 --> 1:7:32.940
Robert Ruggiero
If you walked out to a customer tomorrow and it was a, it was a, you know, flex Internet customer.
1:7:32.950 --> 1:7:35.200
Robert Ruggiero
And they said, Keith, I need a router.
1:7:36.170 --> 1:7:39.510
Robert Ruggiero
Your answer could be I can get you a router, you just need to buy.
1:7:40.490 --> 1:7:46.270
Robert Ruggiero
I just need your voice service, so I'm hosted voice with the managed land router comes along with it.
1:7:46.280 --> 1:7:49.90
Robert Ruggiero
You can use it for the switch and you can use it as a router for Internet.
1:7:54.120 --> 1:7:56.430
Robert Ruggiero
Nope, I didn't complexity.
1:7:55.540 --> 1:8:0.110
Keith Lloyd
So now you're saying that you have to have a voice product in order to get the managed LAN.
1:8:1.360 --> 1:8:4.770
Robert Ruggiero
You need to manage last switch that comes with a router.
1:8:8.400 --> 1:8:8.640
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:8:6.220 --> 1:8:9.490
Robert Ruggiero
I don't care what they what you sell it for, you can sell it for anything.
1:8:18.700 --> 1:8:18.900
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:8:9.970 --> 1:8:20.910
Robert Ruggiero
If the customer doesn't have any services whatsoever and you just want to actually sell them managed land so that that they have a switch within their network that they want to manage print service on, you can do that.
1:8:21.630 --> 1:8:22.310
Keith Lloyd
OK, great.
1:8:22.270 --> 1:8:38.730
Robert Ruggiero
I I I guess my my thought process here is that in many cases when you're talking to customers, if that voice conversation comes up and their voice conversation includes hosted, it's gonna require and managed last switch.
1:8:46.330 --> 1:8:48.420
Andrew Taylor
And what is managed land enterprise?
1:8:50.380 --> 1:8:54.930
Robert Ruggiero
Ohh managed Land Air Prize is over here.
1:8:56.680 --> 1:8:57.430
Robert Ruggiero
Good subway.
1:8:57.500 --> 1:9:4.40
Robert Ruggiero
It actually supports 24 connected devices and I'll I'll get to the the visualization and a second it is a scene functionality.
1:9:4.50 --> 1:9:5.70
Robert Ruggiero
It's just a larger switch.
1:9:8.930 --> 1:9:10.970
Andrew Taylor
OK, how many ports is the regular manual switch?
1:9:11.940 --> 1:9:15.50
Robert Ruggiero
It is a, so it's an 8 port or 24 port.
1:9:21.490 --> 1:9:24.530
Rusty Bunton
Is that expandable Bob from 24?
1:9:26.250 --> 1:9:29.730
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, you can sell as many colonies as you want.
1:9:29.740 --> 1:9:39.960
Robert Ruggiero
I mean generally a 24 port switch is is you know for most of cases is going to be the first one you're gonna put out there and people will pull multiple switches within their within their network.
1:9:41.580 --> 1:9:43.150
Robert Ruggiero
You can sell multiples of them.
1:9:43.300 --> 1:9:44.920
Robert Ruggiero
I'm very, you know.
1:9:46.110 --> 1:9:56.740
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, but I I think as you get into the land design of the heaven, that good conversation with them with the customer on you know how many switches they have the currently or what their ideal switch placement looks like.
1:9:56.870 --> 1:10:1.530
Robert Ruggiero
A great conversation to have and to to drag your Essie into that conversation.
1:10:2.750 --> 1:10:4.90
Rusty Bunton
In the Knox support test.
1:10:5.960 --> 1:10:12.340
Robert Ruggiero
Yes, everybody can support it because you guys any more questions?
1:10:12.350 --> 1:10:12.970
Robert Ruggiero
The technical stuff.
1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:14.530
Robert Ruggiero
I'll show you the really cool the second.
1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:15.700
Robert Ruggiero
Really, really cool thing here.
1:10:16.470 --> 1:10:16.770
Jorge Barrera
Yes.
1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:18.130
Robert Ruggiero
Yep.
1:10:16.780 --> 1:10:27.180
Jorge Barrera
Question with these are we going to provide with the I mean the sign for the bill lens segregated traffic in a metropolitan network, for example?
1:10:31.220 --> 1:10:36.510
Robert Ruggiero
So these are E land switches, not land switches.
1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:38.280
Jorge Barrera
OK.
1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:41.870
Jorge Barrera
So.
1:10:37.610 --> 1:10:43.70
Robert Ruggiero
So Yep, we will, yeah.
1:10:50.40 --> 1:10:50.530
Keith Lloyd
OK, Bob.
1:10:51.250 --> 1:10:51.880
Jorge Barrera
You'll no.
1:10:51.950 --> 1:10:57.930
Jorge Barrera
Are we going to also work with the IP schemes and and provide the the internal IP's and?
1:11:2.620 --> 1:11:2.780
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah.
1:11:2.380 --> 1:11:3.770
Keith Lloyd
Bob, go to your other slide.
1:11:3.780 --> 1:11:4.750
Keith Lloyd
You just had up there.
1:11:4.760 --> 1:11:6.590
Keith Lloyd
It discusses the Vlans and stuff.
1:11:6.600 --> 1:11:7.470
Keith Lloyd
Go to your other slide.
1:11:7.480 --> 1:11:8.280
Keith Lloyd
You just had up there.
1:11:8.290 --> 1:11:8.620
Keith Lloyd
There you go.
1:11:8.500 --> 1:11:9.30
Robert Ruggiero
This one here.
1:11:9.560 --> 1:11:10.360
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, it's, it's.
1:11:10.460 --> 1:11:17.490
Grant Sullivan
Local network VLAN management yes, and IP address management and all that kind of stuff within the current LAN, not Wan.
1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:23.90
Robert Ruggiero
Umm.
1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:24.500
Keith Lloyd
It run DHCP forum, he'll give static IP addresses.
1:11:24.510 --> 1:11:28.0
Keith Lloyd
You can build your 10.10 addresses, those kind of things.
1:11:28.70 --> 1:11:30.270
Keith Lloyd
For that, they'll need to do OK.
1:11:31.540 --> 1:11:31.850
Jorge Barrera
OK.
1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:32.180
Jorge Barrera
Thank you.
1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:39.320
Robert Ruggiero
Yep, so there was I and I I didn't want to do the odds chart on this but to but it's a good.
1:11:39.370 --> 1:11:50.980
Robert Ruggiero
It's good that you brought up the the part of the two pager that that we the two page that we produce from a marketing standpoint, it actually shows you supported configurations on page 2.
1:11:51.550 --> 1:11:53.180
Robert Ruggiero
So I'll give you some insight there.
1:11:53.590 --> 1:11:56.30
Robert Ruggiero
There's also some other technical information.
1:11:56.40 --> 1:11:56.580
Robert Ruggiero
They'll give.
1:11:56.590 --> 1:12:5.120
Robert Ruggiero
Make sure you get your hands on from a spec viewpoint so you have more intimate details on what we can and can't support from a configuration standpoint.
1:12:5.420 --> 1:12:6.680
Robert Ruggiero
So did one of the hide it from you.
1:12:6.690 --> 1:12:15.800
Robert Ruggiero
But I also didn't want to drag everybody down in the weeds of the limited time limited time behalf, so hopefully that answers questions I'll get to the cool part.
1:12:15.810 --> 1:12:19.490
Robert Ruggiero
This is the this is one of the more cooler pieces out there.
1:12:20.570 --> 1:12:25.120
Robert Ruggiero
So when was the last time you actually saw a personalized portal view that conterra provided to customers?
1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:31.790
Robert Ruggiero
So they can get understanding of their their switch and router health before we know have we only people say never.
1:12:32.980 --> 1:12:33.400
Rusty Wilson
Never.
1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:42.250
Robert Ruggiero
Alright, so this is what I think is a pretty cool part about this with managed land.
1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:47.850
Robert Ruggiero
Customers will be getting a personalized portal view, so I wish I had a bigger screen on this.
1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:59.890
Robert Ruggiero
We will spend a lot more time in the coming months of like, you know what this portal view looks like because it's I think it's a huge benefit for a customer perspective, but they're going to go in there, be able to take a look at their managed land switches.
1:13:0.100 --> 1:13:2.220
Robert Ruggiero
They'll actually even be able to look at their managed router.
1:13:2.630 --> 1:13:6.380
Robert Ruggiero
So because we're pulling router in there, they can look at the managed router.
1:13:6.610 --> 1:13:8.730
Robert Ruggiero
They can look at things that are attached to the man's router.
1:13:9.780 --> 1:13:10.50
Robert Ruggiero
OK.
1:13:10.60 --> 1:13:28.570
Robert Ruggiero
So they'll be able to look at if you sold them wireless failover, they can look at the wireless failover and they can get a good understanding of what that health looks like, what the traffic flow looks like, they can go in there and they can do similar some things in a limited functionality to actually make changes without actually coming to us and asking us for it.
1:13:29.460 --> 1:13:31.780
Robert Ruggiero
Umm this is a customer facing view.
1:13:33.110 --> 1:13:37.20
Robert Ruggiero
They get to view real time performance stats.
1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:45.360
Robert Ruggiero
They can project future trends out of this portal this dashboard so they can view device health and historic reporting.
1:13:45.450 --> 1:13:49.840
Robert Ruggiero
They can actually schedule reports to drop to them on a weekly or monthly basis.
1:13:49.850 --> 1:13:54.60
Robert Ruggiero
They can schedule alerts that something happens and they want an alert to go to them.
1:13:54.60 --> 1:13:58.960
Robert Ruggiero
As they're the IT manager, so this is a customer facing view and I probably did.
1:13:59.0 --> 1:14:7.310
Robert Ruggiero
I didn't do it justice on making this exciting enough, but hopefully this is a welcome, you know, piece of information for you guys.
1:14:13.830 --> 1:14:17.810
Rusty Wilson
So well, this is required if they have hosted voice.
1:14:20.750 --> 1:14:20.910
Robert Ruggiero
Yes.
1:14:21.50 --> 1:14:21.591
Rusty Wilson
This is E.
1:14:24.290 --> 1:14:24.940
Rusty Wilson
OK, I'm.
1:14:24.950 --> 1:14:32.570
Rusty Wilson
I'm just getting concerned with with the mom and pop shops that we're we're throwing always requirements and more cost on them.
1:14:32.980 --> 1:14:37.370
Rusty Wilson
Ohh so it's not optional, it's mandatory.
1:14:37.580 --> 1:14:45.340
Robert Ruggiero
But yeah, I mean today, today we don't we I mean we don't put we don't put the phones in anywhere without us without a switch.
1:14:46.730 --> 1:14:48.390
Robert Ruggiero
So there's there's no difference there.
1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:55.670
Robert Ruggiero
It's just that you we're providing a benefit from a from a managed managed which perspective?
1:14:54.790 --> 1:14:56.710
Rusty Wilson
You should you tell me.
1:14:56.110 --> 1:14:58.10
Andrew Ellender
But the point should be that we're.
1:14:56.720 --> 1:14:58.830
Rusty Wilson
There's no, there's no difference.
1:14:58.900 --> 1:15:1.300
Rusty Wilson
There's no difference in cost to them is that we're trying.
1:15:1.310 --> 1:15:1.970
Rusty Wilson
Is that what you're saying?
1:15:3.850 --> 1:15:4.590
Robert Ruggiero
Different groups.
1:15:1.470 --> 1:15:4.970
Andrew Ellender
Yes, there is a difference in cost rusting.
1:15:5.850 --> 1:15:6.170
Rusty Wilson
OK.
1:15:6.890 --> 1:15:8.500
Rusty Wilson
Yeah, well, that's that's my understanding.
1:15:9.560 --> 1:15:9.830
Robert Ruggiero
Umm.
1:15:8.510 --> 1:15:19.320
Rusty Wilson
But we're saying there's no difference to them when we're, you know, there is a custom a large percent of our market is uh ruling anyway, whatever.
1:15:19.370 --> 1:15:20.550
Rusty Wilson
I just wanted to make sure I had that clear.
1:15:21.180 --> 1:15:21.810
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah, yeah.
1:15:21.820 --> 1:15:30.590
Robert Ruggiero
I mean and and again a lot of those, I mean if you think of it this way, you can we can, you know, spend some more time from you know getting to understand what a what a land looks like.
1:15:31.80 --> 1:15:41.520
Robert Ruggiero
But you know, unless you are just running a the laptop and no other computers connected at your business, right, you need to have.
1:15:41.650 --> 1:15:48.910
Robert Ruggiero
You will need to have a switch or hub if you have multiple compute device connect to each other to get bandwidth.
1:15:49.890 --> 1:16:7.140
Robert Ruggiero
It's you can't run without that, so you know there's benefits there because that mom and pop either they're probably not experts in managing switches and they may have to outsource that to somebody within the community to do it for them.
1:16:7.150 --> 1:16:10.360
Robert Ruggiero
That charges 100 and dollars an hour $150.00 an hour.
1:16:10.730 --> 1:16:12.70
Robert Ruggiero
So there are some benefits there.
1:16:25.900 --> 1:16:26.100
Maribel Mendez
Also.
1:16:12.80 --> 1:16:28.230
Robert Ruggiero
I agree that this additional cost at a monthly recurring basis, but it does provide some benefit to the customer where it's kind of something that can offload, you know to another organization and not have to focus on managing those pieces of their land.
1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:31.650
Maribel Mendez
There's.
1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:36.860
Robert Ruggiero
So, and he and any other questions I know I'm burning up a lot of time here, but I did think this is a pretty.
1:16:37.740 --> 1:16:38.140
Maribel Mendez
There is.
1:16:37.700 --> 1:16:38.190
Maribel Mendez
It is.
1:16:36.990 --> 1:16:39.550
Andrew Taylor
And these are 1 gig, 10 gig or.
1:16:39.210 --> 1:16:47.20
Maribel Mendez
There is usually an out of pocket cost for a router for a customer if they have to manage it themselves.
1:16:47.30 --> 1:16:49.380
Maribel Mendez
So this is something that they're not gonna pay out of pocket anymore.
1:16:39.130 --> 1:16:51.40
Maribel Mendez
There is usually an out of pocket cost for a router for a customer if they have to manage it themselves, so this is something that they're Robertson.
1:16:50.270 --> 1:16:51.220
Maribel Mendez
The router or the switch?
1:16:55.610 --> 1:16:57.450
Speaker 1
I couldn't understand that it was kind of.
1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:58.620
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah, you're you're echoing.
1:17:1.200 --> 1:17:1.800
Maribel Mendez
Can you hear me OK?
1:17:4.380 --> 1:17:4.540
Maribel Mendez
Hello.
1:17:4.760 --> 1:17:5.250
Speaker 1
Keep talking.
1:17:6.900 --> 1:17:8.50
Andrew Ellender
It's it's a little better now.
1:17:14.350 --> 1:17:15.0
Andrew Ellender
We can hear you.
1:17:15.530 --> 1:17:16.320
Robert Ruggiero
Yes, we can.
1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:17.490
Robert Ruggiero
Well, we we used it.
1:17:23.940 --> 1:17:24.840
Andrew Taylor
I'd wanted to ask.
1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:25.90
Robert Ruggiero
No.
1:17:23.470 --> 1:17:25.330
Speaker 1
If you're talking now, we can't hear you.
1:17:26.10 --> 1:17:26.170
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah.
1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:34.170
Andrew Taylor
Are these one gig switches or are they capable of going higher?
1:17:35.790 --> 1:17:37.240
Robert Ruggiero
They are capable of going higher.
1:17:38.690 --> 1:17:46.570
Robert Ruggiero
When I'm gonna try and share with you now is E I'll show you where it sits in CPQ.
1:17:53.510 --> 1:17:58.80
Robert Ruggiero
So again it for lack of better place to putting it sits under hosted voice.
1:18:0.710 --> 1:18:6.630
Robert Ruggiero
Because it's generally required when you sell a hosted seat, you can't sell it.
1:18:6.640 --> 1:18:18.510
Robert Ruggiero
Stand alone if you want to by going to 1 voice hosted bundle going to edge and selecting either enterprise for managed land business.
1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:23.620
Robert Ruggiero
So hopefully that was E it's an easy way to get to it.
1:18:25.740 --> 1:18:31.670
Robert Ruggiero
I'll go ahead and select both of these things just to show you that I've saved it and it's not going to require that you put a voice line on it.
1:18:33.460 --> 1:18:35.220
Robert Ruggiero
Ohh, maybe it is started.
1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:36.890
Robert Ruggiero
Ah sorry.
1:18:40.710 --> 1:18:41.0
Robert Ruggiero
I feel.
1:18:41.210 --> 1:18:45.360
Speaker 1
Bob, we're we're seeing that CPQ product selection slide.
1:18:45.370 --> 1:18:46.810
Speaker 1
If you're showing it in Salesforce.
1:18:45.40 --> 1:18:48.250
Robert Ruggiero
Ohh E The that's why.
1:18:48.260 --> 1:18:49.670
Robert Ruggiero
OK, so let me cancel this then.
1:18:50.80 --> 1:18:50.910
Robert Ruggiero
Thank you tashia.
1:18:51.80 --> 1:18:52.750
Robert Ruggiero
I was too many screens up and running.
1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:53.400
Robert Ruggiero
Apologize for that.
1:18:53.950 --> 1:18:54.430
Speaker 1
No problem.
1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:57.970
Robert Ruggiero
So OK, cancel this to show you exactly where it is.
1:18:57.980 --> 1:18:59.310
Robert Ruggiero
This is a CPQ quote.
1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:7.410
Robert Ruggiero
I'm going to go into the new catalog in his selected 1 voice hosted because that's generally where you're going to be associated with it.
1:19:7.420 --> 1:19:8.90
Robert Ruggiero
So hosted seat.
1:19:8.100 --> 1:19:10.570
Robert Ruggiero
You're gonna have to have a man's land product.
1:19:10.700 --> 1:19:11.560
Robert Ruggiero
So I want to select it.
1:19:14.270 --> 1:19:14.530
Robert Ruggiero
Right.
1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:18.130
Robert Ruggiero
So you will find manage layouts.
1:19:18.140 --> 1:19:19.381
Robert Ruggiero
Say I'm gonna do a E.
1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:25.370
Robert Ruggiero
Doesn't really make what different seed to this right?
1:19:25.380 --> 1:19:28.970
Robert Ruggiero
And then do that, I'm going to have a phone. Right?
1:19:29.710 --> 1:19:31.820
Robert Ruggiero
And then I'm going to go to Edge and I'm gonna fly.
1:19:31.830 --> 1:19:36.720
Robert Ruggiero
Manage land, so I'm go ahead and select either one of these things.
1:19:39.320 --> 1:19:39.540
Robert Ruggiero
Then.
1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:46.0
Robert Ruggiero
When it's done thinking in return back OK.
1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:53.180
Robert Ruggiero
Here and you will see a man's land business, man's land enterprise.
1:19:55.580 --> 1:20:5.230
Robert Ruggiero
So what is available for you guys to select thing and see if PQ again it'll show up as 1575 E It will come for a limited time with the manager router.
1:20:5.240 --> 1:20:7.370
Robert Ruggiero
So that's a four to gate of 40F.
1:20:7.380 --> 1:20:12.730
Robert Ruggiero
It's gonna come with umm SO1 router per location that one router per switch.
1:20:12.740 --> 1:20:14.250
Robert Ruggiero
As you guys know, the customer may.
1:20:15.870 --> 1:20:24.380
Robert Ruggiero
Have the need for multiple switches LAN switches within their building, but they will connect to a single router.
1:20:24.390 --> 1:20:31.470
Robert Ruggiero
SO1 router per location it will come with so.
1:20:34.950 --> 1:20:36.380
Robert Ruggiero
I'll back up a second.
1:20:36.890 --> 1:20:41.630
Robert Ruggiero
So before we jump off to the next bucket of fun, any questions?
1:20:51.40 --> 1:20:51.680
Robert Ruggiero
Beautiful.
1:20:51.740 --> 1:20:52.190
Robert Ruggiero
Cool.
1:20:52.290 --> 1:21:31.690
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, so you know once again when we went to the beginning of this whole thing, there was A and we'll provide the copy this presentation, the Flyers great, the the White Papers, really good piece information for you to kind of read and get an understanding of when the supplies how this applies what the benefits are to it customers from an IT standpoint and your SE's are awesome awesome resources they will be able to help you have this discussion with the customers and put it a little bit more into perspective if needed and so please rely on your ressies they are they a great crutch when it comes to managed land services.
1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:40.550
Robert Ruggiero
So with that said, I have one more one teaser thing to drop out for you guys.
1:21:47.610 --> 1:22:8.380
Robert Ruggiero
So E we're going to do a little bit of audience participation on this one and to get it just a general understanding from so, who's familiar with what Adidas attack is and and how it impacts and customers.
1:22:9.560 --> 1:22:16.90
Robert Ruggiero
So I just want to get a feel for how deep into the details I need to get or how high level I could stay.
1:22:19.290 --> 1:22:26.640
Rusty Wilson
Just what I understand it, it's something that some hacker, whatever it's floods, floods your network, makes it unavailable.
1:22:26.650 --> 1:22:29.20
Rusty Wilson
Is that accurate?
1:22:29.800 --> 1:22:31.70
Robert Ruggiero
That's generally accurate.
1:22:31.300 --> 1:22:36.180
Robert Ruggiero
So today we don't have and today we don't do this for custom.
1:22:36.190 --> 1:22:46.720
Robert Ruggiero
We don't sell this as a service to customers, so today's world, if somebody does it, distribute diesel service attacker.
1:22:46.730 --> 1:22:56.710
Robert Ruggiero
If you'd ask attack, basically they go out there and they're taking a whole bunch of bots and they're saying let's see how much traffic we can send to Rusty's website.
1:22:56.860 --> 1:23:5.120
Robert Ruggiero
Or Rusty server with the intention of just making it unavailable so they're doing something malicious to make it unavailable so they are flooding that.
1:23:6.220 --> 1:23:11.90
Robert Ruggiero
So today's world, our customers still are susceptible to DOS attacks, right?
1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:16.130
Robert Ruggiero
So we do stuff to protect our network, but we don't do stuff to protect our customers.
1:23:18.420 --> 1:23:24.220
Robert Ruggiero
So it's basically a threat to service availability on business continuity.
1:23:24.270 --> 1:23:35.750
Robert Ruggiero
It will impact their brand reputation because if you were site or service go down and you're and you're trying to sell things to the outside world, it really looks bad from an organizational standpoint.
1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:38.770
Robert Ruggiero
It's also them some impact from security view.
1:23:39.320 --> 1:23:42.500
Robert Ruggiero
So do you Doss texts are out there all over the place.
1:23:44.60 --> 1:23:58.760
Robert Ruggiero
And what we're doing with this new solution is we are providing managed DDoS that would mitigation, MSD loss protection as a service, right.
1:23:58.940 --> 1:24:9.350
Robert Ruggiero
So this is something that we can provide to any customer who is a conterra Internet customer and I'll get into the details of what the impact is from a monetary standpoint in a second.
1:24:9.720 --> 1:24:13.50
Robert Ruggiero
But basically what we're doing is we're doing Deepak inspection at the edge.
1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:18.70
Robert Ruggiero
So we're so it's a very quick time for to mitigate service.
1:24:18.80 --> 1:24:18.630
Robert Ruggiero
So did U.S.
1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:22.550
Robert Ruggiero
Tax happens, we can mitigate service from that particular customer.
1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:28.990
Robert Ruggiero
We have a live Dudas tech monitoring dashboards and we'll there's a little picture on the left hand side.
1:24:29.0 --> 1:24:29.490
Robert Ruggiero
I'm not going to.
1:24:29.500 --> 1:24:33.990
Robert Ruggiero
I don't think I'm going to go into the gory diesel till details of what it looks like right now.
1:24:34.0 --> 1:24:45.450
Robert Ruggiero
We'll do that later on, but there is a dashboard customers can actually see and they can see whether there's a DDoS attack and they could, they could see what's happening and what IPS is the address ranges.
1:24:45.460 --> 1:24:50.870
Robert Ruggiero
It's actually impacting umm so it is a live dashboard.
1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:57.600
Robert Ruggiero
They're gonna be able to see to provide historical DDoS attack reporting, and then there's automated event alerts.
1:24:57.610 --> 1:25:11.990
Robert Ruggiero
So if the customer wants to know, uh, you know, every time that their network is, there's a details tech it's associated or from on their network and they want to know that even though we're mitigating it, we can act, they can actually set up alerts.
1:25:12.330 --> 1:25:16.40
Robert Ruggiero
Umm to to get that information right?
1:25:16.50 --> 1:25:18.800
Robert Ruggiero
So this is all on a wonderful little new dashboard.
1:25:19.450 --> 1:25:44.210
Robert Ruggiero
It does remove all DDoS traffic from destined for the network, reroutes it through Security Service, and basically, well, I say a top notch, you know, DDoS mitigation and and umm platform, so does the Super high level, we'll get into a lot of details from a D Dos education perspective it in the next few weeks.
1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:50.630
Robert Ruggiero
But I want to at least give you a high level understanding what details tech is and what a CONTERRA managed details service is.
1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:57.870
Robert Ruggiero
So before I before I move on to the impact portion, is there, is there any questions on this?
1:26:4.10 --> 1:26:6.220
Tracy Vincent
Bob does this slow down the system very much.
1:26:4.430 --> 1:26:6.890
Jorge Barrera
He has work question, yeah.
1:26:6.310 --> 1:26:7.310
Tracy Vincent
The legacy you have it.
1:26:8.680 --> 1:26:9.70
Robert Ruggiero
It was.
1:26:9.80 --> 1:26:11.430
Robert Ruggiero
This is something that's gonna be integrated into our network.
1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:13.380
Robert Ruggiero
It's not gonna say there is no slowdown.
1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:15.170
Robert Ruggiero
I'm you.
1:26:15.220 --> 1:26:16.620
Robert Ruggiero
You will not notice a slowdown at all.
1:26:18.50 --> 1:26:21.440
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, it is matter of fact customers that actually do have this.
1:26:21.450 --> 1:26:23.880
Robert Ruggiero
What will notice an increase in bandwidth speech?
1:26:24.50 --> 1:26:29.220
Robert Ruggiero
Because we are taking malicious traffic and we're and we're isolating that.
1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:33.400
Robert Ruggiero
And they're not going to be consuming any malicious traffic.
1:26:35.190 --> 1:26:35.530
Tracy Vincent
Thank you.
1:26:36.90 --> 1:26:36.270
Robert Ruggiero
Yep.
1:26:37.550 --> 1:26:45.640
Jorge Barrera
Now the remediation is going to happen after the attack is occurring or is going to be actively scrubbing the IP's.
1:26:45.650 --> 1:26:48.250
Jorge Barrera
'S I packages all the time.
1:26:47.230 --> 1:26:52.330
Robert Ruggiero
Uh, it it is actively scrubbing traffic, so they're active scrubbers.
1:26:55.110 --> 1:26:56.80
Robert Ruggiero
Which is being mean.
1:26:56.150 --> 1:27:3.800
Robert Ruggiero
It's part of the reason why we we had we put it so close to our Internet peering points because we didn't want it to transverse network.
1:27:3.850 --> 1:27:11.160
Robert Ruggiero
So if some point we get into the more details, we'll get some design documents on how exactly that flow looks like from a network perspective.
1:27:11.450 --> 1:27:12.880
Robert Ruggiero
Also, you know great information.
1:27:12.890 --> 1:27:17.40
Robert Ruggiero
It'll be included in in in the in the one pagers.
1:27:17.630 --> 1:27:42.600
Robert Ruggiero
The reason that this is such high level today is because this is a this is a September offering, but the way that we're we're moving towards the product solution we have to we have to sub really some messaging today to existing base and then get in getting you guys up to speed on what it is.
1:27:42.610 --> 1:27:44.20
Robert Ruggiero
So we can start selling it.
1:27:44.430 --> 1:27:53.200
Robert Ruggiero
It'll be available in September time frame with some more detailed information from a white paper and in products look perspective.
1:27:55.190 --> 1:27:58.50
Jorge Barrera
Are we doing it right now for our clients or not?
1:28:0.70 --> 1:28:3.60
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, that's a loaded question.
1:28:3.70 --> 1:28:10.740
Robert Ruggiero
So if you think about what we're doing from a DDoS protection standpoint, basically we're black hole in the traffic.
1:28:11.340 --> 1:28:14.950
Robert Ruggiero
Umm I as a purist would not consider that DDoS protection.
1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:20.380
Robert Ruggiero
We're not doing stroke, scrubbing and mitigation, so there is a level of protection out there.
1:28:21.0 --> 1:28:25.30
Robert Ruggiero
This is a very high level of protection that we're providing our customers.
1:28:25.40 --> 1:28:33.800
Robert Ruggiero
So there's a big difference and you'll see that we're, you know ones, quote unquote free and the other one has a price tag associated with it.
1:28:34.0 --> 1:28:36.260
Robert Ruggiero
But it's like night and day.
1:28:41.830 --> 1:28:42.320
Robert Ruggiero
Gotcha.
1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:48.510
Robert Ruggiero
Alright, so this is more of an awareness thing from you guys perspective.
1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:51.130
Robert Ruggiero
Again, new logo service.
1:28:51.140 --> 1:28:54.240
Robert Ruggiero
We're gonna target August 2023 as availability.
1:28:54.380 --> 1:29:5.930
Robert Ruggiero
So when we actually get to the August 232332023 availability section, can't speak today on his tied, we'll have a lot more details from a white paper spective.
1:29:6.0 --> 1:29:16.220
Robert Ruggiero
We'll have we'll spend a lot more time doing some training, but the way this thing is working currently is that we're putting this in our network, you know, with a September target date.
1:29:17.70 --> 1:29:21.270
Robert Ruggiero
And this is something that our enterprise customers are going to be receiving.
1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:30.270
Robert Ruggiero
So existing enterprise customers going to be receiving this, I'll for the for the benefit of the folks that are on the call that are not enterprise.
1:29:30.910 --> 1:29:37.390
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, this is something that's not going to be applied directly to education or government.
1:29:37.900 --> 1:29:56.710
Robert Ruggiero
It is something that we can actually sell to them as a separate solution, but for enterprise customers, if you're an asymmetric learning Internet customer on the enterprise side, it is a Doss protects surcharge that will be added to that customer circuit at $15 per month.
1:29:57.550 --> 1:30:3.370
Robert Ruggiero
So umm, high level customers buying something that looks and feels like asymmetrical.
1:30:4.250 --> 1:30:7.360
Robert Ruggiero
I'll remove we have called that in the legacy pass from legacy catalogs.
1:30:7.810 --> 1:30:21.130
Robert Ruggiero
If it's not a symmetrical bandwidth customer flex or whatever $15 month surcharge, if there is symmetrical Internet customer then DDoS protected is applied to those customers at $40 per month surcharge.
1:30:22.110 --> 1:30:26.280
Robert Ruggiero
So there is a there is a there's an opt out for existing customers.
1:30:26.290 --> 1:30:43.490
Robert Ruggiero
We'll get to that screen in a second, but basically in the future I won't spend too much time on the pricing plans because that is a new catalog discussion, but it will be included in pricing plans on when the new catalog is released.
1:30:44.810 --> 1:30:46.440
Robert Ruggiero
So I did say a lot.
1:30:46.450 --> 1:30:57.280
Robert Ruggiero
I'm going to pause here because I know that there's probably any of you guys that are stored supporting existing customers may have questions that I don't want to.
1:30:57.860 --> 1:30:59.630
Robert Ruggiero
I don't want to gloss over your questions.
1:31:1.150 --> 1:31:4.420
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, before, before people get on here and start talking about it too.
1:31:4.430 --> 1:31:6.0
Grant Sullivan
I just want to make sure that everybody understands.
1:31:6.10 --> 1:31:15.370
Grant Sullivan
So we've got two months of a biller message going out, giving customers the ability to to call in and opt out.
1:31:15.380 --> 1:31:29.610
Grant Sullivan
So if they call you directly and they want to know about the service, you know it is an active DDoS mitigation product that we're putting into the network mining and I access considerable amount of capital to be able to do this for protection for all of our customers.
1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:33.570
Grant Sullivan
And but the customer decides that they don't want that.
1:31:34.40 --> 1:31:38.150
Grant Sullivan
They can opt out before the September 1st billing and matter of fact, they can opt out anytime.
1:31:38.380 --> 1:31:42.880
Grant Sullivan
They want to after that and we will take them off of that service.
1:31:44.590 --> 1:31:56.880
Grant Sullivan
But you know it's it's something that that we have seen, you know, an increase in in DDoS attacks and instead of, you know taking a customer and blackholing them and they lose their Internet service.
1:31:56.890 --> 1:32:1.300
Grant Sullivan
This is actively scrubbing it, saying the service through and it is a huge benefit to them.
1:32:4.70 --> 1:32:4.790
Grant Sullivan
They'll pause there.
1:32:14.230 --> 1:32:19.200
Keith Lloyd
So we are going to send something out to our existing customer base explaining what this is gonna be.
1:32:20.270 --> 1:32:21.980
Keith Lloyd
It's gonna be in their bill, basically.
1:32:24.290 --> 1:32:24.840
Robert Ruggiero
Absolutely.
1:32:25.740 --> 1:32:25.870
Keith Lloyd
Yeah.
1:32:24.850 --> 1:32:27.50
Robert Ruggiero
So the bill message is is going out.
1:32:27.130 --> 1:32:28.600
Robert Ruggiero
So what is the bill message here?
1:32:28.810 --> 1:32:34.180
Robert Ruggiero
It will point the customers to a a website for more detailed information.
1:32:34.190 --> 1:32:36.970
Robert Ruggiero
Obviously there's limited real estate on the bill message itself.
1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:39.820
Robert Ruggiero
So this is the website.
1:32:39.830 --> 1:32:50.220
Robert Ruggiero
Here we see if I get the window working correctly and we go that lake is live, we'll make sure you guys have a copy of it.
1:32:51.700 --> 1:33:2.770
Robert Ruggiero
It does a lot more detailed information than it was shown on the screen before, but it gives you a good explanation of what it is, why we're doing it and it gives instructions on what to do if you decide to opt out.
1:33:2.820 --> 1:33:6.370
Robert Ruggiero
So if you decide to opt out, they were going to call the support team.
1:33:6.380 --> 1:33:7.540
Robert Ruggiero
There's 800 number there.
1:33:8.960 --> 1:33:9.400
Robert Ruggiero
Umm.
1:33:10.930 --> 1:33:21.70
Robert Ruggiero
And the support team will be, you know, there will be asking the questions, which is basically helping them fill out this due to loss form.
1:33:21.80 --> 1:33:22.330
Robert Ruggiero
Hopefully this works as well.
1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:24.180
Robert Ruggiero
See how grip my links are right now?
1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:25.640
Robert Ruggiero
Umm.
1:33:26.90 --> 1:33:28.110
Robert Ruggiero
Limited information what they're looking for, right.
1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:28.890
Robert Ruggiero
Customer name.
1:33:28.900 --> 1:33:31.690
Robert Ruggiero
The account number, OK, customer needs to know their account number.
1:33:31.700 --> 1:33:32.170
Robert Ruggiero
Right.
1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:37.440
Robert Ruggiero
Who they are the date and then you know why they want to opt out.
1:33:37.690 --> 1:33:39.320
Robert Ruggiero
And that's really what they're looking for.
1:33:39.330 --> 1:33:51.960
Robert Ruggiero
So this is not this is not really a place for us to where to try and obviously convince them to stay, but we're not gonna be arguing with with them if they if they say I want to opt out so.
1:34:1.270 --> 1:34:1.640
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah.
1:33:54.990 --> 1:34:1.810
Keith Lloyd
Mark, I believe our contract states we have to give a 30 day notice to change any pricing to customer there from not mistaken.
1:34:1.650 --> 1:34:2.360
Robert Ruggiero
So this went.
1:34:2.410 --> 1:34:4.100
Robert Ruggiero
Yep, absolutely it does.
1:34:4.350 --> 1:34:8.400
Robert Ruggiero
This went this started going out the first invoice that went out was July 1st invoice.
1:34:8.410 --> 1:34:14.350
Robert Ruggiero
So we'll do it through July invoice and the August invoice and we expect to actually apply this in September invoice.
1:34:16.590 --> 1:34:18.360
Robert Ruggiero
So message will go out.
1:34:18.370 --> 1:34:20.470
Robert Ruggiero
Customers may or may not notice.
1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:30.100
Robert Ruggiero
They probably won't notice an impact on their invoice until at Lisa September time frame and even at that that increase is probably is less for the most part is less than 10%.
1:34:30.110 --> 1:34:33.990
Robert Ruggiero
So it may not actually draw their eye to the change at all.
1:34:42.540 --> 1:34:43.20
Robert Ruggiero
Correct.
1:34:43.430 --> 1:34:43.690
Robert Ruggiero
Correct.
1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:43.970
Keith Lloyd
So our D Dash product does not require a router at the edge, correct? OK.
1:34:44.760 --> 1:34:54.770
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, it will be something that you can actually it it it at some point you know probably when we release new catalog it'll be it'll be something that you can add on to every single Internet.
1:34:56.690 --> 1:35:2.860
Robert Ruggiero
I'm service silt so any so every single Internet connection sold you can add add on to it DDoS protection.
1:35:3.740 --> 1:35:4.60
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:35:4.70 --> 1:35:4.450
Keith Lloyd
Thank you.
1:35:4.550 --> 1:35:6.230
Joshua Moore
Well, this may be a billing question.
1:35:7.570 --> 1:35:8.200
Joshua Moore
Ohm.
1:35:9.20 --> 1:35:10.250
Joshua Moore
Is this gonna be?
1:35:10.300 --> 1:35:16.210
Joshua Moore
Is this gonna show up under the the regular and the regular section of the billing?
1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:18.870
Joshua Moore
Or is it going to be under like the taxes and fees, that kind of thing?
1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.210
Joshua Moore
Where will it be listed on the billing?
1:35:23.100 --> 1:35:24.70
Robert Ruggiero
That's a good question.
1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:33.300
Robert Ruggiero
I think my takeaway from this, Jeremy, is that is to make sure that you guys have a E visualization of what that mock or what that invoice looks like.
1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:40.370
Robert Ruggiero
I I don't wanna commit to an answer because I'm not 100% positive it is a surcharge though.
1:35:43.740 --> 1:35:44.630
Robert Ruggiero
But I'm all I'll.
1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:49.370
Robert Ruggiero
I'll get with billing team and see if we can post something about a A. You know what?
1:35:49.380 --> 1:35:50.990
Robert Ruggiero
The invoice might possibly look like.
1:35:59.380 --> 1:36:2.70
Andrew Taylor
For the premier Internet, OK, it's.
1:36:2.380 --> 1:36:5.10
Andrew Taylor
And this this is 40 bucks a month.
1:36:5.200 --> 1:36:8.110
Andrew Taylor
Doesn't matter if they're 100 man or 10 gig.
1:36:8.360 --> 1:36:9.320
Andrew Taylor
It's 40 bucks a month.
1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:10.910
Robert Ruggiero
Correct.
1:36:16.390 --> 1:36:17.521
Blake Gunn
And really get this E.
1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:22.210
Robert Ruggiero
I will tell you because you're you have a you have a history of selling larger circuits you you can get a lot more than $40.00 for it 100% get a lot more to 40 bucks for it.
1:36:22.220 --> 1:36:31.590
Robert Ruggiero
So when you start talking about 1 gig and above circuits, try maximize your dollars because people think it's a huge benefit in $40 is probably underselling it.
1:36:33.580 --> 1:36:34.250
Andrew Taylor
Correct.
1:36:34.370 --> 1:36:34.820
Andrew Taylor
Yeah.
1:36:33.570 --> 1:36:35.230
Todd Smith
But but isn't this is her charge.
1:36:35.90 --> 1:36:35.750
Andrew Taylor
It it, it isn't.
1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:37.590
Robert Ruggiero
When, when?
1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:41.190
Robert Ruggiero
When you get when you start selling from new catalog and it's a product that goes along with it.
1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:45.310
Robert Ruggiero
And look at these things.
1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:51.170
Andrew Taylor
And this will be per serving.
1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:52.210
Robert Ruggiero
But existing customers is a surcharge when you start selling this to new to new customers, it's a product.
1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:57.190
Andrew Taylor
Well it be per circuit.
1:36:57.980 --> 1:37:0.470
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah, E umm.
1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:10.420
Andrew Taylor
So for example, multilocation Maggie land, they got a primary circuit and have a secondary circuit, another location, and there needs to be to on the bill, one for each of the the BI's.
1:37:12.70 --> 1:37:12.410
Robert Ruggiero
Right.
1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:12.650
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah.
1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:16.940
Courtney Meadows
Hey, Bob.
1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:24.240
Robert Ruggiero
11 for each Internet circuit then you could probably you could probably just design it so that you can hang it back off of 1 problem Internet circuit multi locations and minimize that but that's a discussion to have with Russia.
1:37:27.70 --> 1:37:27.410
Rusty Bunton
Umm.
1:37:28.330 --> 1:37:28.630
Andrew Taylor
Ohh.
1:37:28.300 --> 1:37:31.720
Courtney Meadows
So when I renew a customer and it's already so it becomes a surcharge.
1:37:31.730 --> 1:37:36.210
Courtney Meadows
When you first add it, but then I renew them, it's then going to be moved to an actual product.
1:37:36.620 --> 1:37:37.260
Courtney Meadows
Is what you're saying?
1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:40.150
Robert Ruggiero
Yes, it will.
1:37:40.270 --> 1:37:40.510
Courtney Meadows
OK.
1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:46.860
Robert Ruggiero
I think we we need to have a broader discussion about Max Courtney at some point in time because I think it impacts you get more than most other people.
1:37:48.250 --> 1:37:54.880
Robert Ruggiero
But when you do renew it, if you're you'll be renewing on the new catalog and it would turn from a surcharge to A to A to a regular charge.
1:37:56.120 --> 1:37:56.470
Courtney Meadows
OK.
1:37:56.560 --> 1:37:56.960
Courtney Meadows
Thank you.
1:38:1.150 --> 1:38:4.630
Rusty Wilson
To all this additional revenue that retires our quota, right?
1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:11.170
Robert Ruggiero
Ohh boy.
1:38:11.670 --> 1:38:12.180
Rusty Wilson
Yeah, I try.
1:38:11.940 --> 1:38:13.90
Rusty Bunton
I don't know why he's laughing.
1:38:16.500 --> 1:38:35.260
Robert Ruggiero
It can make it easier for you to retire your quote because looking this way you can sell managed land and you can you know that that's this no revenue that you can get on to an account to help retire your quota and it provides a benefit and at some point you'll be able to sell you know managed Doss as a as a separate line item which is another easy way to help retire your your quota.
1:38:35.310 --> 1:38:38.560
Robert Ruggiero
So just looking out for your rusty.
1:38:37.630 --> 1:38:49.820
Speaker 2
So Bob, are you saying we're gonna build these customers this automatically and they have to be upset and call us to get it taken off?
1:38:50.170 --> 1:38:51.790
Speaker 2
I think maybe I'm misunderstanding.
1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:54.250
Robert Ruggiero
I think you nailed it.
1:38:54.260 --> 1:38:58.470
Robert Ruggiero
You you were you're you're probably not as soft as I put it.
1:38:58.480 --> 1:38:59.630
Robert Ruggiero
But yeah, that's that's about right.
1:39:1.270 --> 1:39:7.740
Robert Ruggiero
We will build them automatically on the beginning of their September invoice and they have the ability to opt out or call in and say I don't want it.
1:39:8.630 --> 1:39:8.900
Robert Ruggiero
Umm.
1:39:8.910 --> 1:39:9.580
Robert Ruggiero
And then we will.
1:39:8.770 --> 1:39:20.150
Speaker 2
Is there any way we could proactively get a list of the people this will impact and call them and try to get them to either agree or opt out before?
1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:26.570
Robert Ruggiero
I mean the song we can look into.
1:39:26.820 --> 1:39:31.670
Robert Ruggiero
I mean, think of it this way, I would say that 95% of our customers are Internet customers.
1:39:32.910 --> 1:39:44.160
Robert Ruggiero
So you would be calling a lot of customers within your markets and to talk to them about emotions that aren't, umm, specifically geared to adding revenue to the Conterra bottom line.
1:39:46.270 --> 1:39:57.330
Robert Ruggiero
So I I think the most efficient way of doing it would be to continue with, umm the E you umm you know, build message and reaction every stance.
1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:4.880
Robert Ruggiero
But we can definitely look into getting new a list of larger customers if you wanna spend the this cycles to call them.
1:40:6.300 --> 1:40:9.430
Speaker 2
And does this also mean that we are doing some filtering?
1:40:9.440 --> 1:40:20.480
Speaker 2
I think some of the messaging that we've sent out before is that can Tara doesn't in any way uh monitor, filter or mess with your your data traffic.
1:40:23.570 --> 1:40:26.970
Speaker 2
Does this mean that now we do some content filtering?
1:40:26.980 --> 1:40:29.540
Speaker 2
Or, I mean, obviously we'd have to, right?
1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:29.690
Robert Ruggiero
The yeah, we're.
1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:36.490
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah, it doesn't work cause we're not monitoring, we're not filtering content.
1:40:37.50 --> 1:40:42.100
Robert Ruggiero
We're actually, we're actually looking at IP address ranges and treating them.
1:40:44.700 --> 1:40:47.840
Robert Ruggiero
We we're, I wouldn't call it filtering.
1:40:47.890 --> 1:40:57.570
Robert Ruggiero
We're we're we're looking at IP address ranges for behaviors that look like DDoS attacks and and and separating that out or mitigating it, umm, so it has nothing to do with content.
1:41:1.190 --> 1:41:1.450
Speaker 2
OK.
1:41:1.170 --> 1:41:1.860
Grant Sullivan
That's right.
1:41:1.970 --> 1:41:3.490
Grant Sullivan
Except was that Stephanie that was talking.
1:41:3.990 --> 1:41:4.730
Speaker 2
Yeah, it was.
1:41:5.350 --> 1:41:5.740
Grant Sullivan
Yeah.
1:41:5.750 --> 1:41:18.400
Grant Sullivan
So Stephanie, you know, in in all essence, you know, I would you know, if you have strategic customers that you wanna, you know hit up in advance, you know we you know certainly should, you know encourage that that if you want to call them and talk to them about it or whatever, whatever.
1:41:18.410 --> 1:41:30.430
Grant Sullivan
And let them know that it's coming and then we can have some discussions with your sales engineers or whatever about the benefit of keeping it and having it, I think that would be that would be Tom will spin, right?
1:41:32.130 --> 1:41:32.680
Speaker 2
Agreed.
1:41:32.690 --> 1:41:51.550
Speaker 2
I think it's a conversation that opens up an opportunity to talk about a lot of additional products without waiting until they're angry that we added a fee just to see if they don't notice, you know, so proactively call them and say, you know, we're a different provider than we were when you first signed up.
1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:57.270
Speaker 2
And we have a lot of different products it could, it could lead to a lot of upsell opportunity.
1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:0.500
Speaker 2
And Rusty's question, I think was valid.
1:42:0.510 --> 1:42:11.450
Speaker 2
Is there an opportunity to retire quota with this or sell them additional service that would retire quota?
1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:14.40
Rusty Bunton
Agree.
1:42:19.350 --> 1:42:21.230
Grant Sullivan
You talk about our existing embedded base.
1:42:22.680 --> 1:42:32.310
Speaker 2
Or I mean even with this with this D DOS trying to find a way to to make it to where we can earn additional revenue because of this motion.
1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:44.330
Robert Ruggiero
Umm yeah, I I think just if I wasn't me wasn't, you know, reiterate this, this will be a product that you could sell.
1:42:45.40 --> 1:42:55.120
Robert Ruggiero
It'll it'll probably it'll happen with the new catalogs released at the end of August, we may be able to try and do something earlier than that and that'll help you retire quota.
1:42:55.130 --> 1:42:58.40
Robert Ruggiero
So it will not consistently live as a surcharge.
1:42:58.50 --> 1:43:1.690
Robert Ruggiero
It does live as a surcharge for existing customers.
1:43:5.440 --> 1:43:12.140
Keith Lloyd
So the existing customer, if they have an incremental increase in their monthly recurring billing, we can't use that to retire anybodys goal, right?
1:43:20.970 --> 1:43:21.160
Grant Sullivan
Yeah.
1:43:20.270 --> 1:43:21.240
Robert Ruggiero
And just say someone on that.
1:43:21.250 --> 1:43:22.660
Robert Ruggiero
It's gonna say that's a good sales question.
1:43:22.710 --> 1:43:24.990
Robert Ruggiero
Maybe we should have Adrian press that.
1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:28.970
Keith Lloyd
That's what the question is here guys.
1:43:29.260 --> 1:43:30.500
Robert Ruggiero
Umm OK.
1:43:30.110 --> 1:43:30.830
Michael Brady
That is correct.
1:43:32.10 --> 1:43:32.960
Michael Brady
Keith, that is correct.
1:43:35.830 --> 1:43:38.330
Jorge Barrera
Well guys, I believe we are going to.
1:43:37.550 --> 1:43:40.320
Keith Lloyd
Correct that it will not retire, go or will.
1:43:40.390 --> 1:43:41.70
Keith Lloyd
I'm sorry I didn't.
1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:46.990
Keith Lloyd
Yep.
1:43:40.700 --> 1:43:49.360
Michael Brady
Exit that correct these surcharge part of this which is going against the embedded base an opt out environment will not retire quota.
1:43:49.970 --> 1:43:50.190
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:43:49.850 --> 1:43:59.440
Michael Brady
All new customers sales up upsell sales go forward, will retire court post September 1st.
1:44:1.10 --> 1:44:1.380
Keith Lloyd
OK.
1:44:1.390 --> 1:44:1.710
Keith Lloyd
Thank you.
1:44:1.40 --> 1:44:6.850
Michael Brady
Product will not be launched until September 1st, so post September 1st it will retire quota.
1:44:10.470 --> 1:44:19.640
Tracy Vincent
When I go in two months billing so or in situations where their billing goes to a corporate address and they're gonna have some situations there, it probably just one offs.
1:44:19.650 --> 1:44:25.790
Tracy Vincent
But is it gonna just be in that one month billing payment?
1:44:28.770 --> 1:44:29.160
Robert Ruggiero
So.
1:44:29.170 --> 1:44:32.600
Robert Ruggiero
So Tracy is gonna be it's gonna remain on the on the invoice.
1:44:32.670 --> 1:44:42.810
Robert Ruggiero
We don't plan on taking it off until after September invoice is released, but it is possible that we continue to have it on there for a month after, but they'll get at least two months notification.
1:44:47.380 --> 1:44:55.270
Andrew Taylor
Is this service work only for a conterra owned IP addresses or the customers running BGP with their own IP space?
1:44:55.580 --> 1:44:56.560
Andrew Taylor
It'll work there as well.
1:45:8.260 --> 1:45:16.630
Robert Ruggiero
I wanna see Conterra only I will verify with engineering team and get back to you on that.
1:45:17.660 --> 1:45:21.170
Hayden Tuttle
Ohh yeah Bob, I I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
1:45:21.230 --> 1:45:35.50
Hayden Tuttle
We typically even if the customer is using their own IP space, will have a peering IP with and Tara owned IP range, which we can use to monitor the the DDoS.
1:45:36.650 --> 1:45:37.70
Robert Ruggiero
Thank you.
1:45:37.970 --> 1:45:38.150
Hayden Tuttle
Yeah.
1:45:38.130 --> 1:45:39.280
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, I think that's right.
1:45:39.290 --> 1:45:41.960
Grant Sullivan
And then you know, it's protected at the edge of our period point.
1:45:41.970 --> 1:45:46.340
Grant Sullivan
So I think anything that the traverses through those IP's, yes.
1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:50.900
Tracy Vincent
We don't do DHCP anymore.
1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:51.400
Grant Sullivan
Well, we will confirm Temple.
1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:55.170
Rusty Bunton
The Bob weekend.
1:45:55.180 --> 1:45:58.970
Rusty Bunton
Uh, the customer could opt out, and then we could go talk to them.
1:45:58.980 --> 1:46:2.200
Rusty Bunton
And then convince them to get the dedos and get credit for them, correct?
1:46:4.930 --> 1:46:5.310
Robert Ruggiero
You could.
1:46:6.860 --> 1:46:7.650
Speaker 2
And how much is it?
1:46:9.700 --> 1:46:10.650
Robert Ruggiero
Yeah, it it.
1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:21.270
Robert Ruggiero
It is for and for asymmetric customers is $15 per month and for symmetrical customers it's 40.
1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:26.720
Robert Ruggiero
So in in today's world, if you sold them flex, it's $15.00 a month, and if you're sold them premiere, it's 40.
1:46:28.510 --> 1:46:33.220
Speaker 2
And that will also have taxes and fees, USF and things like that on top of it.
1:46:35.620 --> 1:46:41.930
Robert Ruggiero
I'm not sure what the E, but maybe yes, I'm not sure what the tax implications of them that MRC are yet.
1:46:50.270 --> 1:46:50.570
Speaker 2
OK.
1:46:43.300 --> 1:46:51.100
Robert Ruggiero
Umm, you haven't actually finished building it only because we don't need to apply it till September, but we'll have some answers on that.
1:46:51.110 --> 1:46:52.340
Robert Ruggiero
Oh, we actually get closer to release.
1:46:58.130 --> 1:46:58.440
Robert Ruggiero
Umm.
1:46:54.690 --> 1:47:1.300
Speaker 2
OK, I'm trying to understand the impact of these smaller customers that you know, the ones that $2.00 makes a difference.
1:47:1.590 --> 1:47:2.290
Speaker 2
Thank you for that.
1:47:3.470 --> 1:47:4.70
Speaker 2
You'll let us know.
1:47:6.750 --> 1:47:7.460
Robert Ruggiero
Yes, I will.
1:47:7.960 --> 1:47:8.420
Speaker 2
OK, cool.
1:47:7.470 --> 1:47:21.720
Robert Ruggiero
Yes, I because I think I mentioned earlier we we kind of owe you a picture of what it looks like on a customer's bill and so that that will that will be umm you know that image will contain things like like whether it's us self or federal charges so.
1:47:34.530 --> 1:47:35.420
Speaker 2
That's a good question.
1:47:35.430 --> 1:47:43.580
Speaker 2
In the chat, is there any SLA component if we miss AD DOS it's a really good question.
1:47:55.60 --> 1:47:59.560
Robert Ruggiero
I don't think that there's any RSL is today.
1:47:59.570 --> 1:48:5.681
Robert Ruggiero
Don't cover D dos so EAE.
1:48:5.70 --> 1:48:20.140
Speaker 2
I think like specifically as it pertains to this product, if we're saying that we're gonna prevent these cyber attacks, how much are we liable for if they get attacked anyway and we charge them for that protection?
1:48:19.130 --> 1:48:22.90
Robert Ruggiero
They're they're they're going to get attacked.
1:48:22.100 --> 1:48:26.300
Robert Ruggiero
I I think at the end of the day, what we're doing is we're telling them that we're mitigating that attack.
1:48:27.90 --> 1:48:27.440
Robert Ruggiero
Umm.
1:48:28.110 --> 1:48:35.100
Robert Ruggiero
On their behalf so that they're not feeling the impact of that attack on the Internet bandwidth.
1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:39.10
Robert Ruggiero
So we're isolating and mitigating it for them.
1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:40.810
Robert Ruggiero
We're not. We're not.
1:48:41.20 --> 1:48:44.990
Robert Ruggiero
We're not telling the customer that they're not gonna get details attacked.
1:48:46.710 --> 1:48:55.870
Robert Ruggiero
We're we're just protecting that them from the impact of that is close to the Internet peering pointer handoff as possible.
1:48:55.880 --> 1:49:4.690
Robert Ruggiero
So we are we are protecting that 100 Meg bandwidth for example, so that it's only bandwidth that's that's that's clean.
1:49:7.890 --> 1:49:8.680
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, that's right.
1:49:8.690 --> 1:49:10.210
Grant Sullivan
And you know, Stephanie, there's.
1:49:11.750 --> 1:49:15.680
Grant Sullivan
There's all kinds of information out there that we need to get to you guys about.
1:49:15.770 --> 1:49:20.670
Grant Sullivan
You know how common these tasks are are actually more common.
1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:39.900
Grant Sullivan
You probably think the impact to a customer, even a small businesses, what happens to them when a DDoS attack actually occurs and they can't process payments and do this and all that kind of stuff, we need to get all that information to you so that you have that in your arsenal to be able to talk to your customers about.
1:49:42.660 --> 1:49:43.810
Grant Sullivan
But like to boss point.
1:49:43.10 --> 1:49:45.840
Speaker 2
At one point I had a statistic like 4%.
1:49:45.850 --> 1:49:48.960
Speaker 2
It costs 4% to protect yourself against an attack.
1:49:48.970 --> 1:50:1.140
Speaker 2
I mean the average cost of an attack, things like that are really powerful from a sales standpoint to be able to to say, look, it's $15.00, but imagine if you can't process transactions for an entire day, what is your business?
1:50:1.150 --> 1:50:3.450
Speaker 2
Lose 100 grams a day.
1:50:3.990 --> 1:50:4.190
Grant Sullivan
Yeah.
1:50:3.690 --> 1:50:9.310
Speaker 2
All those business owners like to boast about that, so any any information you can arm us with would be very helpful.
1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:10.930
Grant Sullivan
Yeah.
1:50:10.940 --> 1:50:13.130
Grant Sullivan
And I'll give you a just a real quick example.
1:50:13.140 --> 1:50:25.920
Grant Sullivan
At a previous company, there was a kid that didn't wanna take his his high school testing that week of school and went on the black market, bought a $50.00 details attack and took down the servers for four days.
1:50:26.900 --> 1:50:35.980
Grant Sullivan
And so that us at the other company did not have a active DDoS scrubbing mitigation product.
1:50:35.990 --> 1:50:37.160
Grant Sullivan
We just took it in black.
1:50:37.170 --> 1:50:44.630
Grant Sullivan
Hold them to not affect other customers and you know the school system was was pretty upset about that.
1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:51.510
Grant Sullivan
So that's, that's the kind of stuff that can be super detrimental to a customer's business, right?
1:50:51.560 --> 1:50:53.440
Grant Sullivan
And we need to arm you guys with that information.
1:50:53.450 --> 1:50:58.110
Grant Sullivan
So you have it, but this is a huge thing that we're putting in for protection for our customers.
1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:7.60
Grant Sullivan
And you know, we do need to, you know, it is a item that we do need to to get some revenue for.
1:51:7.670 --> 1:51:14.160
Grant Sullivan
At the same time, so it is a value add, but it makes their internets strong, dependable.
1:51:14.170 --> 1:51:18.800
Grant Sullivan
And you know, Brady, now go back and forth about what to call it clean Internet or something like that.
1:51:18.810 --> 1:51:25.710
Grant Sullivan
But he has all kinds of cool names for it, but it it's really going to fortify.
1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:36.810
Grant Sullivan
Umm, the Internet product and and make us different from other customers cause a lot of other service providers don't include this or not at the charge that that we're charging for it.
1:51:37.40 --> 1:51:41.450
Grant Sullivan
I think it lumen for you know, a couple 100 mags are up to a gig service.
1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:43.870
Grant Sullivan
They're charging $1000 a month, something like that.
1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:46.450
Grant Sullivan
Something crazy for that separately.
1:51:47.200 --> 1:51:50.780
Grant Sullivan
So it's just we're taking a different model.
1:51:50.790 --> 1:51:53.880
Grant Sullivan
Look at it versus how other telecom companies are doing it.
1:51:55.310 --> 1:51:57.970
Grant Sullivan
So it's going to separate you in in your, in your local markets I think.
1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:0.731
Speaker 2
Can you get us some of the E?
1:51:58.810 --> 1:52:1.70
Keith Lloyd
Yeah, this will change the narrative for sure.
1:52:2.290 --> 1:52:3.0
Speaker 2
I'm sorry, go ahead.
1:52:2.60 --> 1:52:6.580
Keith Lloyd
This will change the narrative of the conversation that you have with your customer.
1:52:6.780 --> 1:52:7.70
Adrian Garcia
Yep.
1:52:6.850 --> 1:52:8.320
Keith Lloyd
Being able to offer these products.
1:52:12.90 --> 1:52:13.530
Adrian Garcia
Yeah, I mean that's that's that's.
1:52:12.540 --> 1:52:14.390
Speaker 2
Can you get us any of the information?
1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:19.650
Speaker 2
Like what other providers do up from a smaller business standpoint on on this?
1:52:19.660 --> 1:52:23.200
Speaker 2
Like what they charge or or if they do it or don't do it type of thing.
1:52:25.850 --> 1:52:26.700
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, absolutely.
1:52:26.710 --> 1:52:27.180
Grant Sullivan
Must.
1:52:27.230 --> 1:52:27.500
Grant Sullivan
Yeah.
1:52:27.510 --> 1:52:29.640
Grant Sullivan
And I'll tell you, most competitors don't.
1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:34.780
Grant Sullivan
They charge for it, but they charge one off and they charge lots of money for it.
1:52:36.100 --> 1:52:36.340
Adrian Garcia
Yep.
1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:39.690
Michael Brady
Yeah, here.
1:52:38.870 --> 1:52:39.970
Rusty Wilson
So so back.
1:52:39.940 --> 1:52:41.210
Grant Sullivan
It's because it's expensive.
1:52:39.700 --> 1:52:48.30
Michael Brady
There's a big difference between active active and non active, so the on demand videos is not expensive.
1:52:48.860 --> 1:52:57.870
Michael Brady
Active dedos is expensive, so when you go out and you look at all this stuff, you're gonna see you're gonna see a plethora of ways people charge for this.
1:52:58.500 --> 1:53:0.300
Michael Brady
People charge for it on bandwidth.
1:53:0.310 --> 1:53:1.830
Michael Brady
People charge for it at port levels.
1:53:1.840 --> 1:53:4.190
Michael Brady
People charge for it at incidence levels.
1:53:4.300 --> 1:53:18.20
Michael Brady
People charge for that hourly, so big customers with 10 gig ports, they get hit as you black hole it you and you, you mitigate it and someone out else is out there trying to figure out what's going on.
1:53:18.730 --> 1:53:20.800
Michael Brady
You know, there's all sorts of ways to change this.
1:53:20.810 --> 1:53:30.290
Michael Brady
This is a simplified way for us to give a different level of security across all of our IP ports to everybody that we have right.
1:53:30.340 --> 1:53:34.770
Michael Brady
It is an opt out opt in environment right?
1:53:34.820 --> 1:53:41.810
Michael Brady
And it's a something that you can sell as a value going forward or giving you two months a heads up here.
1:53:41.900 --> 1:53:48.210
Michael Brady
So if you do get a call or if somebody ask you now know what's going on, right?
1:53:48.220 --> 1:53:50.610
Michael Brady
I mean, truly, it's been out there for seven days.
1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:56.610
Michael Brady
First build cycle was July 1st so now you have a heads up here you know.
1:53:56.620 --> 1:54:11.370
Michael Brady
But as we roll out all of this Fortinet platform guys, it is a cloud first, security, first platform, everything is about moving all applications to the cloud and all applications in the secured environment.
1:54:12.80 --> 1:54:18.910
Michael Brady
So what we've done is we've taking that we've taken a service that we have on our backside that we utilize for our own protection.
1:54:20.570 --> 1:54:30.500
Michael Brady
We've now made this forward facing to the customer, so we can now provide that at a customer level and our own across the platform.
1:54:30.510 --> 1:54:37.800
Michael Brady
The Fortinet platform, which is the number one platform in the world right for cloud and security.
1:54:38.50 --> 1:54:40.500
Michael Brady
So use that to your benefit to keys point.
1:54:40.610 --> 1:54:42.240
Michael Brady
Change the conversation, guys.
1:54:42.510 --> 1:54:44.820
Michael Brady
This is not a me too Internet port.
1:54:44.830 --> 1:54:46.310
Michael Brady
We've never sold Me 2 Internet.
1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:49.70
Michael Brady
We've always said we're different.
1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:51.470
Michael Brady
We're trying to help that difference now.
1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:59.910
Michael Brady
Now this one's gonna cost a little bit because there's massive value to it, but it two weeks just or two months of we have these discussions.
1:55:0.80 --> 1:55:10.390
Michael Brady
So come September 1st, when you can sell it or the the actual charge surcharge hits a hits the invoice, you can be prepared for that.
1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:13.650
Michael Brady
So these are great questions, great conversations.
1:55:13.820 --> 1:55:15.170
Michael Brady
I love the engagement.
1:55:15.180 --> 1:55:25.910
Michael Brady
So first time that we've caught your attention with something new, you know, and I think we've caught your attention because it's cyber and we've also caught your attention because there's a cost associated with it.
1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:42.840
Michael Brady
So it's a combination of both, but think about this guys, as we go through this storytelling event that we're going through and we're changing our conversations with our customer, even the smallest mom and pop shop, right, let's just say they do $1000 a day or $500.00 a day.
1:55:44.740 --> 1:55:47.890
Michael Brady
If they can't process that stuff, it costs them.
1:55:48.40 --> 1:55:49.110
Michael Brady
That's their livelihood.
1:55:49.940 --> 1:55:53.200
Michael Brady
We're trying to give them some level of protection with that we can't protect.
1:55:53.210 --> 1:55:57.530
Michael Brady
You're never fully protected in today's world, but we can stop it.
1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:1.530
Michael Brady
To where no longer you gotta 1000 people trying to pound 100.
1:56:1.540 --> 1:56:4.950
Michael Brady
Make port and they can then do something different, right?
1:56:5.40 --> 1:56:11.330
Michael Brady
They can go to the wireless backup that will then give them some level of service connectivity.
1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:25.310
Michael Brady
They can use their cell phone, they can do something different, but they will know that there is a deed auto attack going on on their port and we can show them that all of the stuff that you see from a portal perspective that will be available in this service too, right.
1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:29.780
Michael Brady
Grant will be able to give them kind of portal or visibility into uh.
1:56:29.790 --> 1:56:35.330
Michael Brady
Any attacks or any of that sort of stuff as well, right in regions on their port or all the other stuff.
1:56:35.340 --> 1:56:38.750
Michael Brady
So it's a pretty dynamic view that we're able to give to our customers.
1:56:39.770 --> 1:56:43.860
Michael Brady
I don't know if you and we'll get you some of those examples too, guys, but great questions.
1:56:43.50 --> 1:56:48.890
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, it does have a customer facing portal where they can go and log in and and look and all that kind of stuff.
1:56:48.900 --> 1:56:51.700
Grant Sullivan
And that's some of the stuff with all the different portals.
1:56:51.710 --> 1:57:2.710
Grant Sullivan
You know, views that we're gonna have with all of our new products, we've got to develop to develop a singular portal view so that everybody can just go and log into one thing and then be able to get to all the different products.
1:57:7.680 --> 1:57:8.210
Keith Lloyd
That's why.
1:57:5.800 --> 1:57:10.910
Adrian Garcia
And if I'm if I'm hearing this right, you know, it's it's it's to keep's point.
1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:14.500
Adrian Garcia
It's how we deliver the message, so they call asking about it.
1:57:14.550 --> 1:57:19.290
Adrian Garcia
It it basically if you were to come to me, Mr customer, I'd have to sell it to you at a high rate.
1:57:20.210 --> 1:57:24.860
Adrian Garcia
As a company, we decided to offer to all of our customers at a significantly discounted rate.
1:57:25.700 --> 1:57:30.500
Adrian Garcia
So you know, that's basically the way I see it, right, is that, that's accurate.
1:57:30.510 --> 1:57:32.320
Adrian Garcia
We won't be able to sell it at that same charge.
1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:36.50
Grant Sullivan
If, if we were not doing it that way.
1:57:36.60 --> 1:57:37.90
Grant Sullivan
Adrian, you're exactly right.
1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:38.0
Adrian Garcia
Yeah.
1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:44.40
Adrian Garcia
Yeah.
1:57:37.200 --> 1:57:45.990
Grant Sullivan
This the power of of a lot of folks, you know, opting into it is allowing us to to make it consumable for everybody at a lower charge, right?
1:57:50.280 --> 1:57:50.660
Adrian Garcia
Great.
1:57:46.60 --> 1:57:57.400
Grant Sullivan
Otherwise, I mean cause this several 100 thousands of dollars to to to put this in and every Internet peering point that we add going forward, we have to add equipment to those.
1:57:57.410 --> 1:57:58.730
Grant Sullivan
So it's gonna be an active thing.
1:57:58.740 --> 1:58:1.610
Grant Sullivan
It's not like one time and we're done, you know, spending capital on it.
1:58:1.620 --> 1:58:8.280
Grant Sullivan
It's gonna be a capital investment every time we start we upgrade Internet, you know, drains and things like that.
1:58:9.910 --> 1:58:11.240
Adrian Garcia
Yeah, right.
1:58:11.60 --> 1:58:12.10
Keith Lloyd
Yeah, this is a good.
1:58:12.20 --> 1:58:13.50
Keith Lloyd
This is a good thing.
1:58:13.60 --> 1:58:13.270
Keith Lloyd
It's a.
1:58:11.250 --> 1:58:18.580
Adrian Garcia
And I'm just saying from the customer customer message, it'd be it'd be more expensive if they would come to the sales team to get that kind of service.
1:58:19.790 --> 1:58:20.860
Adrian Garcia
Then the opt out fees.
1:58:20.870 --> 1:58:22.780
Adrian Garcia
What I'm saying right this message to the customer.
1:58:24.110 --> 1:58:26.140
Keith Lloyd
Well, this is a really good thing for the customer.
1:58:26.710 --> 1:58:26.910
Adrian Garcia
Yep.
1:58:27.370 --> 1:58:28.920
Keith Lloyd
They may not realize it today.
1:58:28.930 --> 1:58:38.930
Keith Lloyd
It's also a really good thing for conterra, so we need to, like I say, change the conversation, change the narrative to what it the benefits are of it.
1:58:39.120 --> 1:58:41.170
Keith Lloyd
Not that I'm charging you $15.00 a month.
1:58:45.220 --> 1:58:45.620
Adrian Garcia
That's right.
1:58:49.320 --> 1:58:49.910
Rusty Wilson
Is there?
1:58:49.960 --> 1:58:53.190
Rusty Wilson
Uh, I'd like to go back to the service level agreement.
1:58:53.190 --> 1:59:9.820
Rusty Wilson
Like I I know that it's not part of that, but if I've paid three years at $50.00 a month for protection and I get hit with an attack it, that should be some kind of some kind of, I don't know.
1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:16.100
Rusty Wilson
Uh settlement there to to say, hey, this is gonna be an there's gonna be a problem.
1:59:16.910 --> 1:59:33.950
Rusty Wilson
I believe if that happens to them and we give them a month credit, I mean, is there something that we can come up with and say, hey, you know, because everything's 100%, but you know, we'll credit you for this month or whatever that that.
1:59:33.300 --> 1:59:34.700
Grant Sullivan
Well, I think we have SLA's.
1:59:35.510 --> 1:59:35.890
Keith Lloyd
We do.
1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:38.800
Grant Sullivan
Around our Internet access already today, right?
1:59:39.20 --> 1:59:39.210
Rusty Wilson
Yes.
1:59:38.860 --> 1:59:40.380
Keith Lloyd
We we do, yes, we do.
1:59:43.970 --> 1:59:44.480
Rusty Wilson
Oh, good.
1:59:44.490 --> 1:59:44.880
Rusty Wilson
OK.
1:59:40.820 --> 1:59:45.760
Grant Sullivan
I think they would fall within that same, you know that same line up, yeah.
1:59:45.330 --> 1:59:46.90
Rusty Wilson
OK, great.
1:59:48.200 --> 1:59:48.390
Keith Lloyd
Yeah.
1:59:48.400 --> 1:59:54.950
Keith Lloyd
And I'm sure that the Teasing's will reflect those non liabilities regarding that service as well.
1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:55.980
Keith Lloyd
I would hope that it does so.
1:59:58.120 --> 1:59:58.760
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, that's right.
1:59:58.770 --> 2:0:3.930
Grant Sullivan
And we're we're gonna have to change our teams and sees when we get to more and more security type things.
2:0:4.280 --> 2:0:5.890
Grant Sullivan
So you'll see some of that stuff changing.
2:0:5.900 --> 2:0:16.570
Grant Sullivan
We're working with what band and and those guys right now to to adjust some of that, but we'll let you guys know plenty ahead of time of what the wording is and how we're changing it and all that.
2:0:19.40 --> 2:0:19.980
Dagan Soileau
Is there anything?
2:0:19.10 --> 2:0:20.500
Grant Sullivan
I think somebody riser hands too.
2:0:20.570 --> 2:0:20.940
Grant Sullivan
It was that.
2:0:20.920 --> 2:0:41.850
Dagan Soileau
You asked me is there anything that we can do for those in flight orders that we say the ones we just signed, so they haven't been receiving the notices because they're not concurrent customer yet they haven't received any Billings yet that whenever they do finally get turned up in September, October, November, that all of a sudden now they're paying 15 or $40 more?
2:0:41.960 --> 2:0:42.330
Robert Ruggiero
No.
2:0:44.30 --> 2:0:44.940
Rusty Wilson
A good point.
2:0:42.880 --> 2:0:48.40
Dagan Soileau
Than what we had originally signed them for in June and July, may you know.
2:0:50.670 --> 2:0:51.460
Rusty Wilson
That's a great point.
2:0:54.30 --> 2:1:4.870
Dagan Soileau
Maybe that could be something for the project coordinators to blast email blasts like hey, just a heads up, this is what's going to be happening by the time you get turned up when you first billing happens.
2:1:5.800 --> 2:1:7.290
Dagan Soileau
This is going to be an extra charge on it.
2:1:11.530 --> 2:1:13.970
Grant Sullivan
Yeah, that's that's a really good question.
2:1:14.360 --> 2:1:21.330
Grant Sullivan
I don't know that I have the answer for that yet, but let me let me let me think about that and how we we need to to remedy that.
2:1:24.950 --> 2:1:25.440
Grant Sullivan
Who was that?
2:1:25.450 --> 2:1:25.790
Grant Sullivan
Asked that.
2:1:29.90 --> 2:1:30.410
Dagan Soileau
That was me, Dagan swallow.
2:1:30.480 --> 2:1:31.880
Grant Sullivan
Well, again, thanks Dagan.
2:1:37.900 --> 2:1:38.700
Grant Sullivan
More common on that.
2:1:38.710 --> 2:1:40.130
Grant Sullivan
I'll let let me get back to you on that one.
2:1:48.990 --> 2:1:49.330
Grant Sullivan
Alright.
2:1:48.470 --> 2:1:49.430
Adrian Garcia
Alright team, we.
2:1:48.370 --> 2:1:50.580
Speaker 2
Is this going to impact anything like they're IT?
2:1:50.590 --> 2:1:51.580
Speaker 2
People need to change.
2:1:53.510 --> 2:1:53.750
Grant Sullivan
No.
2:1:56.950 --> 2:1:57.410
Grant Sullivan
That happened.
2:1:51.590 --> 2:1:59.930
Speaker 2
Like if they're doing somebody boy over the top or I mean we require that they have IT person put their routers and stuff in.
2:2:1.350 --> 2:2:6.860
Grant Sullivan
No, this is this is all done at the core level at our peering points out to the Internet.
2:2:6.870 --> 2:2:7.960
Grant Sullivan
So they don't have anything to.
2:2:8.50 --> 2:2:9.0
Grant Sullivan
There's nothing needs to be done.
2:2:11.880 --> 2:2:12.220
Speaker 2
Good deal.
2:2:10.550 --> 2:2:19.430
Grant Sullivan
Basically what we're going to do, we're going slide in a piece of equipment in between our peering points and our network that'll be scrubbing the data coming through.
2:2:26.80 --> 2:2:27.250
Adrian Garcia

2:2:27.140 --> 2:2:27.660

Courtney Meadows

2:2:40.340 --> 2:2:46.780
Robert Ruggiero
No, no, that that there's something that you would add for new opportunities to go forward?
2:2:48.410 --> 2:2:48.740
